"Not quite as user-friendly as Turbo Tax, but I had no problem using it.
I would have used the Federal refund gift card + 10% but they did not offer it on Amazon (like Turbo Tax does) so I passed on that.
Still, the cost is reasonable and it seems to work well. Very likely I will use H&R Block tax software again next tax year.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,1
"I've used Quicken versions 2003, 2006, 2008 and now 2011. After ""upgrading"" from 2008 Deluxe I immediately noticed the following:

-- The program opens more slowly and is much slower moving between screens
-- Transactions download from my bank (Chase) very slowly (I use web connect)
-- You can no longer click <enter> to accept downloaded transactions when a match is found in the register
-- There is no more Reconcile button at the top of my register; it's under a new Account Actions button (annoying)

That's just what I've noticed in the 2 weeks I've been using it. On the plus side, it appears to have converted all my 2008 Deluxe data without a hitch. I upgraded because I was forced to by Intuit's 3 year software expiration policy. I have found nothing in version 2011 that wasn't already in 2008, at least for my own needs.

At this point I can only recommend this software if you're an existing Quicken user, are being forced to upgrade, and would rather not re-learn a whole new program. If you're switching from something else, such as Money, you should take the time to research better (sometimes free!) alternatives before putting money down on this. Intuit doesn't make any actual improvements to Quicken every year - it simply refreshes the look of the interface, moves previously well-placed buttons in new locations, and charges you $60.00 for the privilege.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0

"I was a MS Money 07 user until I switched to a Mac desktop and lost my installation key to re-install MS Money on my virtual machine.  I must admit that I LOVED MS Money  and am disappointed that they are discontinuing to make the product. Very robust product with a ton of functionality.

While I've only been using it for 5 days, Quicken Essentials for Mac is not quite as terrible as the other reviewers are making it out to be but there is absolutely room for improvement.  I would say my biggest complaint is lack of flexibility.  You have very VERY little control over the way your data is displayed.  For instance, in the Overview screen, it shows my top 5 expenses for the month, however I have 3 fixed expense categories (rent, loans, and mutual funds) that will always be the top 3.  I'd rather it display the top 7 or maybe the top 5, but allow me to exclude some categories from being displayed.  It would be great if you could customize the Overview screen to display information that would actually be helpful based on your spending/saving goals.  For instance, I'd love for it to show me changes in my mutual funds/stocks, or if I'm spending more than last month on clothes/food/whatever...however it does not.

I heard someone say it ""doesn't do stocks"" however I have stocks and didn't have any problem.  It doesn't automatically update them... I have to go to the web site and download the qfx file but I don't really mind this.  I also have an IRA and a 401k that it auto-syncs.

On the positive side, while the software does very little, what it does do it does decently. There are some nice (though, as aforementioned, uncustomizeable) pie charts, you can create your own categories and tags, and scheduling future transactions went fairly smoothly.

Thumbs Down:
* No flexibility to display data
* Just update automatically or when I open the program!! Instead I have to ask it to update the accounts and go through an irritating dialog.  At least provide a setting for this!
* Very very limited settings and customizability.  Doesn't conform to users needs.  Settings are basically worthless.
* Could use some more stock/mutual fund analysis tools. Nothing fancy - just show me time-over-time increases, my poor/good performers...etc.  Also, you can't really edit any of the mutual fund/stock info.  For instance, one of my accounts doesn't display symbols.  I'd like to type in the symbols myself, however there is no way to do that.

Unsure:
* Budgeting tool - doesn't seem robust enough, however after I get a few more months data in there it might be helpful.
* Matching - I haven't really used this functionality yet.
* For future transactions I had to enter an amount, however there are times I don't really know the amount.  For instance, my heating bill is rarely the exact same each month.  Not sure if QE for Mac is going to pick up on this or not.

Thumbs Up:
* Set up was fairly simple for me.  I was not importing any data (my MS Money file couldn't be imported because I needed the MS Money software operating to export it into a readable fashion)
* Found all of my financial institutions
* Nice little graphics and intuitive layout
* takes advantage of Macs finder/search tool
* can be saved to mobile me....nice.  I haven't actually tried doing this yet or what the real advantage would be.

At this point I'm going to stick with this product because it is better than nothing and I haven't found another tool out there.  Someone recommended YNAB, however after exploring their site it doesn't do mutual fund/stock tracking.  If anyone else knows of a good product, write me a comment!  Thanks.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0

"I support residential and business clients and on one particular business client job, I had the task of salvaging a crashed IDE hard disk and hopefully 7 years worth of business and personal data. In my tool kit, I had a SATA hard disk, a USB SATA hard disk dock, and an Acronis CD which is bootable on the off chance Windows won't boot up. On this job I ran a separate utility to move data to good locations of the hard disk and mark of the bad sectors/blocks. Once this completed, I attempted to boot into Windows XP and was successful. Now it was time for Acronis. I restarted the PC but booted into Acronis instead of Windows and chose the option to clone the drive to the good external SATA hard disk I had. It did this without any errors. I then verified with the client that all their data was now on the cloned SATA drive and then I simply cloned the SATA drive back onto a replacement IDE hard disk I had purchased for Their PC. End result: Other than having to replace a Windows XP .dll file and reinstalling their wireless mouse software, all their data and Windows XP was intact and they were once again able to work as if the hard disk hadn't crashed. I was a hero to them and it felt good. Now, for non techs, it is one thing to back up data to an external hard disk or on a cloud server but in the event of a hard disk crash, having to reinstall Windows (usually not an option if it came on your PC) and all your applications takes up a lot more time than I would guess you have. That is where Acronis shines as a backup program. You do one full backup of your entire system (includes data)and then use Acronis' backup scheduler to automatically do weekly or even daily incremental backups that back up only the changes that occurred since the initial full backup. Once it is set up, all you have to do is make sure your external backup hard disk is turned on the day and time your backup is scheduled for. In the event your hard disk crashes beyond repair, you have the hard disk replaced, boot up with the Acronis CD and restore from your backup, everything! Operating system, data, Outlook settings, pictures, music, videos, everything that was there before the crash. Bottom line: I've used this software for 3 years, now and I swear by it.

Update: I have since installed Acronis True Image 2011 version on my PC and a new option is available in this version and the one prior to it called ""Nonstop Backup"". What this does is do an initial full backup and then running in the background, it frequently checks for changes and then records only those changes as it detects them. This means, if you have a critical problem with Windows or a hard disk crash in the evening and you get a replacement internal hard disk, you can recover your Windows, programs and data from that morning's backup file.

"If you have every upgraded software before, you are well aware that there is a learning curve associated with the new software.  Even if there are some neat new features, it can take some time finding how things are done differently.

I have been using Word 2003 and Excel 2003 for over 10 years and I am very comfortable with how it works.  I did not see anything wrong with those versions.  The newer version included in Office 365 (which seems to be the 2007 versions) have a totally different look and feel. I am having trouble seeing any real benefits to the upgrade.  Maybe with time, I will become accustomed to the newer version and hopefully will find some benefits. But right now, all I am doing is spending a lot of time learning the new layout/functions.

The one huge benefit I can see is that you can now store your files in the cloud.  Microsoft offers up to 20GB of online storage included with the subscription price.
This allows you to be able to access your files from any location where you have Internet access.

There are a couple of other new features that may be beneficial  OneNote and Outlook.  Personally I do not use Outlook so that is of no value to me.  I am just exploring OneNote but is seems like it has some good features that may prove helpful.

I am not a big fan of subscription software.  I think it is possible to pay for it 2 or 3 times over by buying it as a subscription.

As a lot of people have observed, the Personal version only allows an installation on one desktop and one laptop.  If you are going to purchase, the Home version seems to be a better deal.

I am still getting used to the new version and often when in a hurry and need to get something done will work in my 2003 versions.  Those are still fully functional and work fine with no interference from Office 365 (this review was written in Word 2003).",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0
"I got Pocket Money back in 2001 shortly after getting my first Palm pilot. This program alone justifies my need to have a Palm PDA. I have used it for keeping track of my money transactions for since then. I can have several accounts stored in the program, and run transfers between them. The very first transaction is dated July 24, 2001 and it still appears on record.

It's even helpful for budgeting. When I deposit money, I get on this program and start deducting off future bills and upcoming expenses. The convenient part is I can mark these accounts as ""not cleared"" which means I can see two different totals, one being the actual total and then the ""Cleared Totals"" only.

Repeated transactions can be done automatically as well. Just set up a transaction and then tell it how often that transaction will occur.

You can password protect entry into the Pocket Money program. Also, notes can be added to transactions (so you can store receipt numbers or other info). You can set limit alerts on particular account. If you pass that limit, the program displays a message.

You can also set categories for particular transactions.  For instance, if I buy something for my business, I just mark it under the category `business (or anything you want).  Then, when Tax time rolls around, I can view just the transactions under the business category.  Makes it easier to remember what needs to be deducted.

I've had this program follow me through my Palm M100, a Handspring Prism, yet another Handspring Prism (first one met an unfortunate demise), and finally my Treo 650. Its especially convenient that Hot-sync backs up the database. I've had a few harsh crashed and I've been able to get my database back every time (minus un-synced actions).

When I was considering getting a smart phone, the ability to load a good working money management program was a priority, so it made getting the Treo a good deal.

While I do really like this program, there are some quirks I've noticed over the years.

1. I have one automatic transaction that I can't seem to stop. I no longer need the program to stop repeating this particular transaction but for some reason it won't stop. In the end, every 15th of a month I have to delete that action manually.

2. Despite what the box and instructions said I never seemed to manage importing/exporting into Quicken or Microsoft Money. I'm using Version 2 so maybe the Version 3 they are selling works better. I was a little upset about this at first, but I think I like it better as a Stand-Alone. I use Microsoft Money for verifying my accounts and Pocket Money for in the field record keeping. Besides, every time you sync your device IT WILL BACKUP the Pocket Money database, which is good enough for me.

3. Some higher functions, like ""rolling up transactions"" crash the device. This has happened every time I try to do those functions and on every device I have had. I don't know what the deal is, but I haven't needed those functions so I guess its not important.

I'm giving a review based on Version 2.0 of Pocket Money and they're selling Version 3.1.2 now. I'm sure there might be some changes and improvements, but based on the screenshots from Handmark's website, it looks very similar to my version. Just a few added bells and whistles. I'm considering moving to the newer version, and probably starting fresh (four years of records can a database really large.)

Even with those quirks, I still give this program 5stars. I can't believe how simple and easy it has been for me to keep up with my transactions with this on my PDA. It has helped me keep a closer eye on my bank accounts and also helped me be more aware of my spending habits. This program really is worth trying out.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,1

"I consider myself pretty handy with computers and figured that I could migrate programs/data from my old XP machine to my new Win7 PC in an afternoon or so.

"I got suckered into buying Microsoft Office for Mac 2008 because my wife's office had upgraded their PCs to whatever the PC version of the latest of Office is, and we wanted to be compatible with the new Word docx files.  Of course, in real life, very few people seem to be using docx files, even in mid-2009, so upgrading to docx is basically pointless. After installing the new 2008 version of Office on our Macs at home, I immediately noticed Word, Excel and PowerPoint programs took longer to open than the 2004 versions.  I also noticed that Word and Excel especially were loaded with a bunch of features that no one really needs and generally distracts from what I'm trying to create on my Mac.  It's as if Microsoft once again answered consumer questions than nobody ever asked.  After using Office 2008 for the Mac for about six months, I finally decided to remove and trash it from my Mac.  I'm back to using the 2004 version and am much happier with software that is easier to use with less distracting bells and whistles that I don't need to type a memo or prepare a spread sheet. My latest experience with another ""innovative"" Microsoft product helps me better understand why Microsoft stock sells in the low $20's while Apple's price is nearing $170 a share.

"If I could give it one star, I would. First of all, reconciling is a mess. They no longer eliminate already-reconciled transactions, nor do they have different columns for debits and credits, so you have to look at a long list of transactions that all look the same to find the one you're attempting to reconcile. Also, reconciling will only go back so far, so if you have an old transaction that has finally cleared, you have to leave reconcile - which is kind of a pain unto itself, find it somewhere, click the reconcile button, then go back to reconcile. I also prefer the register to LOOK like a register. Now, to get all the info I need, I have to squeeze it all into one line since the 2 line format is gone. But today, I'm trying to print a report for the accountant, and there is no ""category summary"", tho it SAYS 'category summary'. In their report, each category lists EVERY SINGLE transaction for the year. My account doesn't care about all that. He wants the totals.

"I think there are a lot of fake reviews on this site about the new Windows 8 platform.  This is not one of them.  The software is very shoddy, clumsily put together, and not intuitive at all.  The interface is clumsy and not responsive to commands. Microsoft has been very greedy with app development, and it shows. If you need a reason to get an Apple, well, Microsoft has provided you with one.
I am in the computer business and I am very worried about installing Windows 8 in any of my new machines.  They have taken a terrific operating system, Windows 7, and made it impossible to use in a comfortable way.  Honestly, I have no idea what they were thinking up.  And I really hate to say that. Because in the end, Microsoft products are the bread-and-butter of my industry. This epic fail is going to impact my wallet in an unpleasant way. I wonder how long it will be before Windows rollback DVDs are included with new PC purchases. Just like they did with Vista and XP.
But this is really a surprise to  anyone?  Microsoft has a long history of success, then failure, then success, then failure.  This is another failure after a success. When they bombed with Vista they came out with Windows 7. I am going to hold out now for windows 9 when shortly the bugs and garbage from windows 8 will be removed.
In the meantime, take the advice from a professional and avoid windows 8 like the plague.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0

"Streets & Trips 2005 with GPS is a GREAT product. I have used it on 2 road-trips across Ontario and it performed very well. There were times when the GPS couldn't receive a signal, possibly due to poor weather or tall buildings (I was in Toronto). However, after driving a bit further, the signal usually recovered. During these down-times, I had to use the step-by-step directions and follow the map the old-fashioned way.

In one case, my wife and I took the wrong exit ramp on a busy highway and were able to get back on track very quickly due to the GPS showing we were heading in wrong direction. The ""re-calculate from current position"" function is worth the price of the GPS alone since it helps you get back on track after taking wrong turns/exits.

Another great feature is that the map re-orients itself to the direction you are heading in, like turning the map yourself.

The only drawback to S&T2005 is you need to have a laptop with a long-lasting battery or car adapter.

For all those people who get lost easily when driving, or have an incredibly bad sense of direction, I can personally recommend you get this. It's worth the value.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,1

"Hi there.  When I first got this unit I was very excited.  This was after Owning Nuvi 350,660,775t (3) Magallan 4370's and a 4250.  I now tried a Tom Tom 740 live

Overall opinion I wanted to Love it.  When it works correctly it routes much better than the Garmin I'm assuming because of the IQ Routes.  I also like the weather and Gas prices.  Most of all I love the Google Search.  I can just plug in a name of a doctor and it will Find it. (or any other business)  It was much better in finding an address of a house on a block than Navteq.  In otherwords it was right on.  (where 4990 was it was)

What turned me off on this unit was a few things. fundementally The unit does not turn on when you turn the ingition, The gui is complicated (when you are in a rush) It does not list traffic problems when off route and yes it rebooted a few times. What I also didn't like about Tom Tom was the fact that the left turn right turn voice was very confusing, Sometimes it didn't mention the street name and when it told you to turn it was not time to turn yet.  There was also a issue with auto reroute When I didn't listen to Tom Tom it kept silent and late into the route it told me an alturnative way.  With Garmin you can know it's working because the minunite you get off route it says RECALUCATING. So in that area with Garmin I felt more secure.  Even with these flaws I was  willing to live with these issues if my routes were almost perfect.

four times in 3 weeks this thing got me lost.

 When I did a test to my mothers house it didn't leave me in the right development and it was way off by a mile or 2.

For my business I was suppose to go to a client on A1A in Halendale beach Fl it left me in Hollywood. (thank god I know the area)

One time comming from my friends house I wanted to go to a Pizza place The pizza place was off a main intersection on 172 st.  I think it took me down 173 or 174th street, made me go in a circle back to 172 and all the way down.  All I had to do was make a left on 172st and it was on the corner.

Lastly I was going to Miami from Tamarac (Broward County) and I had to keep on 95.  a Fault of mine was I was not paying attention to the street sign but the lane assistance thing said stay in the left lane.  Well it took me off to an exit in a bad area in Miami and I couldn't find my way back to 95.

Other issues When I first got the unit I had to go though Tech support to get my map update and after the update the gas prices was not working so I had to call back to get that resoloved.

Conclusion believe it or not I will miss this Tom Tom maybe I should of waited it out.  because when it worked it was better than Garmin.  But with the Garmin I never did get lost (I can rely on it to get me to where I have to go even though it may not be the best route.)  I will for sure miss google Maps but as a consulation I did purchase MSN direct and believe it or not it has weather,even a radar, The gas prices are more accurate, it has news and stock reports, and movies.  so in that area I gained.  The Garmin is a much easier interface for me to use while driving.  But yes it has it's quarks also but I hope it will improve.  Thank god I have my own good sense of direction so around here for business I really just need to know the local streets.  what I really wanted the relabilty for was when I was out of town.

Magallen all I have to say about it is they all freeze, or the screen is slow.  and with my last one the power adapter broke in 1 week I just don't have time for this.

How do I feel about having a Garmin back.  Lets put it this way I'd love it to be perfect.  But since we sold our country to the rice fields in China that won't happen.  It's good, I feel it could be better.  Tom Tom would of been great if they had a better mapping system.  The idea of routing with iq maps is awsum.  But Garmin takes me on good routes also. The thing about Garmin that made me switch back to them is the reliablity, From what I remember the company was very customer service friendly and they seem to know there stuff.  (I don't know about now) but I do know from past experiences they do improve there products.  As a matter of fact before my 755t got stollen Garmin took me on a round about way to get to mom's 4 months later I got this 765t and it has been corrected.  I know in the future I will be buyiny other GPS's and hopefully then they will have what I'm looking for.  But for now I will stick with this because I've used Garmin for my business for years and for me it seemed to be the least stressful for a varitiy of reasons. which include fuctionality and reliablity in routes.  Poi's that needs to be improved. (thats why I chose this tom tom but with that I even went back to Garmin) So....

With Garmin if I choose I can get Lifetime map updates and also lifetime msn with tom tom it's a 10.00 per month for the service and you have to purchase the maps.  I am hopeing Garmin will start to have maybe a yahoo search or something like the google search, I am also hoping Garmin will have the traffic data on there maps similar to IQ Routes.

This Tom Tom has great Potential But man they have to improve on the small stuff I mean let the unit go on automaticly when you start the car even magallen does that.  How about an answer of we can fix your reboot problem instead of I don't know.  For the kind of money we spent I firmly belive that a accurate lane assistance on 95 would be the least to ask for, And we need less of an error rate of 4 mistakes in 3 weeks.  Great idea on iq routing and it works great but please make it more reliable before selling it to the general public.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,1

"I have purchased a version of Norton every year for over 16 years for its virus scanning capabilities.

I've been using Norton Internet Security the past few years in spite of it not giving me as much control as I'd like.  But none of them were as bad as this version of Norton Security.  It nagged me EVERY DAY because I chose not to install its toolbar in Chrome - in spite of checking the option (every day!) to never remind me again.  I finally gave in and installed it.  Then I promptly disabled it because I just don't like 3rd party toolbars in my browsers.  Guess what?  Now the stupid software is nagging me again because the toolbar is disabled!  Argggggghhhhhhh!!!  Enough already!  Norton Security has become the MALWARE that it's supposed to protect me against!

You still have to pay $19.99 per state tax return you e-file.  When I finished my sixth tax return (I was wrong and thought it offered six free federal e-filings), I went through the process, paid the state e-filing fee only to be informed that I had reached the limit.  TurboTax downloaded another one for me, but I couldn't transfer the tax data I had already filled out, and I couldn't import it to their online returns since it was 2008 data.  TurboTax said I would have to buy another version and do the sixth tax return all over on another computer.  I couldn't use my free MD state download or my paid Missouri state download since I had to do it on another computer.

So I purchased this one just to do one tax return and discovered that downloading one state cost $39.99.  Since I had already printed out the Missouri state return from my computer, I skimped and only downloaded MD state return and will paper file the Missouri one.  I still had one unused state e-filing on my previous TurboTax but was told that the two go hand in hand, so you have to e-file the same federal & state, you can't use an unfiled state e-file on another return.

Bottom line is that original version I purchased (see above link) with the free state is now around $41.  This one cost $34.39 + $39.99 for one state = $74.38.  Crazy prices - I wish I had purchased the $41 w/free state download and saved myself some bucks!

Also, since there are five people in my home (only 2 returns as yet though) and friends asked me to do their return, TurboTax should have flexibility so that if you exceed the five limit, you can reload more and not have to pay all over again for another software package, another 2nd state download etc.  I am going to suggest this to them for next year.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0

"Update to below review: I did promise to come back if I found any problems with this product. Some users have experienced reduced battery power (drains faster) after installing it.  I have experienced that but my husband did not.  We are both on macbooks.  My macbook is a year old and his is three years old. I ended up taking my machine into the genius bar.  Apple said iM was not snow leopard.  It said my battery was shot so it gave me a new battery, no charge. my machine has worked like a champ ever since and I still have snow leopard.

This is my original review before the above came to light.  The product remains five stars for me personally.

I am just discovering all the refinements which have gone into Snow Leopard.  However, what I want to comment on is the most important aspect to me.  I came to my Macbook from years of working on PCs.  One good thing PCs did for me was that I became quite a proficient little techie but that was because I was forced to do so.  I lost count of the amount of times I had to reinstall my operating system due to an overall system crash, an Internet Explorer flaw which crashed the whole OS, viruses or trojans or other problems which got past my virus protection software, etc., etc., When I went over to Mac, I was able to retire from being a self taught techie.  I have to do just about zilch on my macbook in order to keep it running well.  I have now used Tiger, Leopard and Snow Leopard.  Each one is an improvement over the last.  There is no bloating factor.  I don't have a bunch of extra software on here which I don't need.  In fact, I picked up about 18 GB of space by switching to Snow Leopard from Leopard.  Snow Leopard is working perfectly for me 24/7 and I have not really had to think about adapting to it.  It is so intuitive that I just find myself doing so automatically.

I always liked the finder and I like it even better now in Snow Leopard.  I've been doing great searches within my folders, getting wonderfully sized images as my thumbnails plus Quick Look is better than ever.  As I set all of my preferences for the whole OS, I discovered that certain things, which were more complicated to do in Leopard, are now simpler to do.  Some specs were removed entirely and macbook just does them quietly on its own in the background, which is fine by me.  I do not miss the hours I spent reading computer manuals as I tried to cope with being a PC user.

After the installation, everything still worked just fine.  I was able to just pick off where I had left off without missing a beat.  I have a David Pogue missing manual book sitting next to me but have yet to open it as I've run into no problems.

Best of all, it was really cheap to buy.  I've never had such a cheap OS yet it is so slick!!!!

It is hard for me to imagine why you would not want Snow Leopard on your Mac.  If I run into such a reason, I will come back and edit this review to include it!",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,0

"Office 2007 is a nice step up from Office 2003 (and earlier) as it has better visuals on the toolbar. e.g. Instead of just seeing the worded commands on the toolbar where one clicks on the command and then gets a drop down list to choose from with more commands, i.e. File, Tools, Edit, etc, you'll see tabs with different commands on the toolbar. When clicking on the tabs, it sets up across the toolbar, all of the functions of that particular tab. Once viewed, you not only see the words of the functions, but also, small example graphs and images of what that functions does. This only applies to all the applications other than Outlook, which pretty much retained the same look and feel as 2003

The load times seem to be much quicker than what I had in the 2003 version. In Outlook, setting up accounts, maintaining names and addresses is much easier too.

"I've used Quicken for perhaps 18 years. I'm invested/trapped into using it, mainly because no other program offers the hope of helping me track many different types of accounts--401K, 403b, 529, checking, savings, etc.

I say ""hope,"" but Quicken 2012 still won't download automatically transactions for 403b and 529 (student savings plans) accounts. 403b plans are, to the person who's using one, identical in nature to 401K plans, in that they invest in mutual funds and they use mutual fund companies (Fidelity, Vanguard, etc.). My wife and I work at a hospital with a Fidelity 403b plan, and because I try to maintain proper investment diversity, each of our accounts has about 10 transactions per month. That's 20 transactions that I have to enter manually, using Quicken's awful transactions utility. Our kid's 529 plan receives only five transactions per month, but those too must be entered manually.

Vanguard's 529 plan says ""Please note: We worked closely with Intuit to be able to offer Quicken download capability; however, we were unable to come to a suitable agreement. The costs of offering download capability into Quicken for 529 accounts were too high, and introducing this feature would negatively impact expenses associated with the program."" In other words, Intuit wanted too much money. I don't know what the issue was/is with 403b plans, but I can only assume that Intuit wants too much money for those downloads, too.

I've found that I have allowed the onerous task of entering these transactions manually to affect my investment choices (arg--do I really want to diversify as much as I should, if I have to enter all those transactions in Quicken?) and it diminishes my ability to track performance (because I often let the task of entering them slide for a few months, and then I don't have a clear picture of what my investments are doing).

The utility for entering transactions doesn't help, either--it's a separate box from the register, and if you've got a browser window on one side of your screen and Quicken scrunched up on the other, you can't see what gets entered into the register until you close it. And in Quicken 2012, it's actually worse, because if you change the investment type (say, from ""add shares"" to ""reinvest
dividends""), it will revert the date to a past transaction date, so you have to keep a very close eye on that date. It was already very difficult to keep track of the dates, funds, share amounts, share prices and transaction totals, and this just makes the task even more onerous.

One of the new features in Quicken 2012 is supposed to be a new larger font option, but Quicken has allowed you to customize the font size for a while now--except in the Investment section (and perhaps others). In the investment section, you can't change the font type or the font size, with all those teeny transactions, that's where the feature would really be useful. If you in a checking or savings register, you can adjust that font size, but you have to dig into a preferences menu--no easy-access buttons, as are often offered on web pages, and no ability to hold down your control button and spin your mouse wheel to increase/decrease the font size.

This is just one of the ways in which Quicken 2012 seems to put lipstick on the pig: Intuit touts some fancy new tools--for example, in its spiffed-up budgeting tool and redesigned debt-reduction tool--but behind these okay-looking interfaces you'll find the same old 1995-era interface. For example, if you try to edit a budget amount in the new interface, you can't edit directly on the screen; Quicken 2012 pops up a dialog box that looks that same as it did in 1995. Enter the amount, click OK, and the interface shifts back to the top of the screen, rather than returning you to the same spot as you were in. The other improvements in this year's upgrade are similarly tepid.

For the past 10 years, the only reason to upgrade Quicken is to maintain the ability to download transactions online--and it's becoming increasingly difficult for me to use it for that.

Ver. 10 works with Windows Vista, which was not true for an earlier version. It is an improvement over ver. 3 which I have used with Windows 98 2nd edition and, with compatabilty adjustments, on Windows XP.

"Corel PaintShop Pro X6 Ultimate junk.

I had to update from Ulead's Photoimpact X3 which Corel purchased and killed off i.e. never updated or supported. As far as I can tell they simply wanted Ulead products off the market....period.

X3 worked and I got lots of work done. I used it every day and never-ever had a problem. I updated to Windows 8 and Corel would not support X3 so I had to go to their X6 product.

6 months of use and I haven't got a single piece of work done. Nothing makes sense, Commands do the weirdest things. I haven't edit a single picture successfully.

"I bought a new Garmin GPS at Bass Pro and this card later via I-net. With this combination the zoom-in function was very problematic. After going back to Bass Pro Shops and trying the card in a different GPS, there was the same problem of lakes disappearing  from certain scales, yet the lakes would be clearly shown on both a higher and lower scale of the exact same area, but not on the problematic intermediate scale. So you could be trying to get from point a to point b, and not even know there was a lake in between to contend with- unless you went up or down in scale and discovered it was there. After speaking with Garmin several times and the afore-mentioned trial with a different GPS, the conclusion was that the problem was with the card. Bottom line is the card works- sort of- but not flawlessly. This is a very serious problem when trying to navigate bush logging roads or trying to navigate in the woods when surrounded by mosquitoes.

"OK.  So I read all the ""spyware"" reviews, and I read the manufacturer's response, and I read some of the other reviews, and I decided to buy the product.  I mean hey, it's $25, I can risk it.  If for nothing else, just to give an accurate review of the product, not just write a ""review"" never having read the terms myself, nor having tried the product myself.

So here's the deal.  ""The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.""  I won't swear on my grandmother's grave, because my grandmother's still alive.  Both of them.  So yeah, you get the point.  Here's an actual product review, not just a bunch of nonsense.

Regarding the ""spyware,"" it doesn't do  much.  In fact, it doesn't do any different than virtually any other program on your computer that can interact with the internet by requiring a license, such as Microsoft Office, Adobe anything, any internet browser, any IM program, heck, even the OS itself.  It verifies that the license is legit and that you're not using a fraudulent copy.  It gathers non-personal, anonymous information regarding your interests so that Corel knows how to properly revise their software for future updates to meet the needs of their clients.  If changes ""default settings"" by allowing it to validate the license and interact with the internet to see if there are any product updates, security updates, etc. that you need in order for your program to run efficiently.

Here's what it doesn't do.  It doesn't gather any personal information.  It doesn't sell that information that it doesn't acquire to third parties.  It doesn't spam your inbox.  It doesn't constantly tie up a whole lot of memory.  (You can view the amount of memory it is using by going to the task manager.)  It doesn't automatically make it to where you can't use another program as the default program to open pictures and such.  It doesn't bypass your firewall and shut it down so that you're computer's at risk for viruses.  It doesn't access your camera and microphone and record video of you while you're doing stuff you're not supposed to do in the first place.  It doesn't monitor your credit card transactions to steal your numbers.  It doesn't monitor your key strokes.  I think you get the point.  It's not spyware anymore than Microsoft Office is.

OK, so the actual product.  It's a decent product.  The user submitted images are really what it can do, and it's really not that difficult to do them.  There are things you can do with it that the beginninger, never having used a photo editing program before, can easily learn.  There are intermediate things that are a little harder, but give a decent challenge to a non-pro.

However, it's not really a professional product.  If you're an extremely good amateur, as in, if you don't own a business and aren't using it as your primary source of income, then the product has a lot of good features for you, and is well worth the price.  For a business, it might be a good backup tool if you don't want to purchase a license of Photoshop for every computer.  It's definitely worth the price, and for some simply things it is a lot easier to do here in PSP than Photoshop.  I'd say it's a whole lot better than the basic editing that you can do with iPhoto for the Mac, and I use that quite a bit when I'm not needing to do anything with layers or combining images.  (I run Windows 7 on my Mac a bit, so that's where I can use PSP.)

Overall, I'd say it's a great product to do simple things with very quickly and easily.  For advanced things, it's still a pretty good product, worth a 4-star review; but for the really advanced things, where you need specialized filters that you purchase separately for Photoshop, it doesn't match up with Photoshop.  However, for what I do in taking pictures of weddings, children, families, scenery, sports, and products for advertisements on eBay; it's worth the money by far.  I'm not a professional, but I make perhaps $1,000-$3,000 a year on photography and graphic design.  I'm not going to replace Photoshop with it, nor am I going to use it most of the time, but if I'm running my Windows for any reason, it would by far be the default program to which I would turn.

So there you have it folks!  My review in a nutshell.  (I hope everyone brought a nutcracker...)  Hope it sheds some light on the actual product, not just a bunch of spam reviews by people who have never used it, bought it, or even read the license agreement for themselves.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,0

"I tried the competitors' products, most notably the Norton products, and I wasn't as impressed with them as I am with Trend Micro. While the competitors all work well, they're also quite bloated and spend a lot of time taking over your system, installing toolbars without offering a path to deactivate them (I hate toolbars in my Internet browser), and asking too much in terms of violating privacy.

Trend Micro is different. It's more streamlined, doesn't hog resources while protecting your PC, and allows you the end-user control that major competitors don't seem to think you should have. Trend Micro installs easily, and updates quietly in the background. It scans and repairs just as smoothly.

My only complaint about this package is that when you install it as a Pro upgrade to a registered, subscribed Trend Micro Antivirus package (the basic version of their paid products), it doesn't take the months you have remaining on your current subscription into account. For example, I had six months left on my Trend Micro Antivirus subscription, and once I installed this Pro package, I had one year, instead of getting one year and six months. My six months are gone, replaced by the new year's worth.  I would like to have seen them find a way to give me everything I paid for in the lesser version, but then add the year on top of that instead of replacing it.

That issue aside, the package handles everything I need on Windows 7, even being smart enough to give me the choice of using Trend Micro firewall or Windows firewall, and disabling the one that's not being used. In contrast, one of the competitors' products actually asks you to turn off Windows firewall prior to running their installer. Trend Micro did it right; That made it easy, and they made it work WITH your operating system instead of working against it.

No complaints here. Top-notch product. Better than the free antivirus packages (way more features) and better than the bigger-name office standards which have grown into bloated, self-indulgent, non-intuitive packages. Trend Micro just *gets it*.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,0

"I just purchased a new PC with Windows 8.1. Problem is that Lotus Organizer, the best address manager I ever used, does not work well with this version of Windows. I thought I would try this EZ app because it has some good reviews. When I installed the EZ it only used up about 26% of my screen space as opposed to 100% with Lotus. The only way I could enlarge this is with other apps that do not make the enlargement permanent thereby being a major inconvenience. That led to the removal of one star.

With just a very small display box the font size is small. I am not saying it is tiny but that it is smaller than comfortable. As is the case with the small display box the font size is not adjustable either. That led to a partial removal of another star. The other part that contributed to the removal of the second star is the lack of cohesive transfer capability with another PC.

This app also is not user friendly requiring too many ""Press"" this, ""Choose"" that and ""Select"" the other.

I am now using StatTrak Address Manager. It provides a nice large display that is easy to read and easy to use. The font size is perfect without any need to squint to read.

Sure, it's not perfect, but I can't think of any other features that I could fairly ask for.  I've been using it to edit family videos (about 1/2 hour at a time) and haven't had a problem yet.

"Smart Surfing for Mac is a little bit difficult to evaluate since it works invisibly behind the scenes.

I've been a Mac user since 1988 and have never had any problems with viruses or malicious downloads, but I thought it would be wise to try a program like this just in case. I ran a full scan on both computers, and nothing risky was found on either. It could be coincidental, but since I installed Smart Surfing, I have had a lot more problems with iWeb and Homepage (no longer a problem since Apple retired this software!) causing me to spend quite a bit of time with Apple Tech Support, who couldn't find any reason for the problems. It could be a coincidence, but I have to wonder. I disabled Smart Surfing on my laptop last night when I couldn't get anything to publish on iWeb after repeated attempts. It didn't clear up the problem right away, so I'm not sure who the culprit is.

"Adobe Captivate started life as Flashcam from Nexus Concepts 2000, then became RoboDemo when acquired by eHelp of San Diego. Macromedia then bought eHelp and renamed the application Captivate. Finally, Adobe acquired Macromedia. So, you could say this application's been around. That is a testament to the usefulness of the concept. Unfortunately, the execution leaves a little to be desired. But before you are completely turned off to this little diamond in the rough, read on to see if it's worth the shortcomings.

To be honest, I've never before used an application specifically aimed at training or demonstration on the web. I typically publish help files in PDF (Adobe Acrobat) format as necessary. That doesn't always help when trying to train someone to use a content management system, or when developing custom solutions for less-than-computer-literate users. So, I went looking for a way to present a more visual experience. Enter Captivate!

First, the good stuff.

Captivate is incredibly easy to use. Just install it and you are ready to start recording presentations. Spend a few moments to learn the shortcut keys, and you can do pretty much everything you need to do for a simple follow-along style demo. When recording is done, you can edit slides, add audio and video, and modify cursor movement. All of this is pretty much as easy as using Power Point.

Recording screenshots is done in a couple of different ways; manually with a key press, or automatically when you click or drag the mouse. Dragging can also automatically record full motion clips. Configuration of these options is quite simple, and offered on a popup window when you start recording a new project. After trying both the automated and manual methods, I chose to capture screenshots by key press, with automatic recording while dragging. This gave me quite a bit of control and more flexibility in choosing what elements to capture, especially because I tend to jump around a lot while working. Rather than grabbing every action then having to remove the useless, incorrect, or unnecessary excursions, I can just take the images that best show the task at hand.

It is also possible to import slides from a PowerPoint presentation, which is good news for those trainers and presenters who have existing libraries of content they want to migrate to Captivate. Export options include standalone executable, zip or swf file, and there is the ability to integrate with Adobe Connect. This feature alone might be worth the price of admission.

Editing the slides is pretty simple for most tasks. For example, you can add highlight regions, move the cursor position and path, and control some effects as well as the amount of time a slide is on the screen. Add some static or animated text to draw attention to important points or areas, and you're golden. There are a number of built-in Flash animation effects for type as well as mouse clicks. You can build more of your own to enhance your presentation or share them with others. Of course, this requires Flash or something that will output the SWF format properly.

Training interactions are also quick to set up thanks to a great mapping view. This lets you see the paths and possible choices when using branching interactions. Captivate can also track responses for SCORM/AICC compliance, a real boon for trainers. Add this to Adobe Connect and you can distribute your training and courses across the world. Literally.

For web work, you will have to pay special attention to file size. Adding extra screenshots, or any audio and video, will significantly increase your file size, in many cases becoming almost unusable for web presentations. A simple demo can quickly get above a few MB, so it will be important to spend some time fine tuning your demo and removing anything that adds weight without having a good reason for being there.

Unfortunately, there are some down sides. The application doesn't feel mature due to lots of bugs. One of the most annoying manifestations is an 'unsticky' window or menu. When this happens, menu items fail to work properly since they disappear before a selection can be made. Typically, the only recourse is to relaunch the application. Sometimes, it saves you the effort of closing it by spontaneously crashing. Save often. Very often.

Another difficulty I have is the lack of flexibility in modifying slides within Captivate. While it is possible to include mouse movements and text entry animations, it is difficult to synthesize them. In fact, it's just not possible in some cases. I would love to see the ability to just place a cursor and path arbitrarily on a given slide, to create the path as a standard Bezier vector for editing, as well as text field examples. Going further, being able to split out menu items on the slides, like drop downs or highlights, would make the files smaller and thus easier to distribute. On the plus side, you can take advantage of round-trip capabilities with Adobe Photoshop, which helps cut down file size and give lots of room for tweaking and custom edits.

Suggested retail from Adobe's site is about $600. For a business or organization that needs to produce training and demo materials, this is a pretty reasonable price for the available features. While there are other solution out there for free, and some that actually cost more, Adobe has a good balance, and if history is any indicator, they will continue to craft this application into a truly indispensable tool for trainers.

The stability issues notwithstanding, Captivate is a very impressive tool. For a full list of features, check out the Adobe Captivate product page.

Overall, I am pretty happy with Captivate. The features are unlike any package I've used, and it's almost embarrassingly simple to create engaging simulations and training. I anxiously await a dot release to fix the problems. Download the demo and build yourself some presentations. And keep an eye out for fixes.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,0

"We recently upgraded to a new computer (I used to have Vista.) The computer wasn't working well at ALL for about a year, but I kept fooling with it mainly because it had WordPerfect on it and I didn't want to get rid of it! I have used wordperfect since the early 90s and love it. We use MSword at work on those machines, and I am so often frustrated with IT deciding what I want to do rather than ~me~ deciding. For example, can't I just hit the spacebar 6 times to make a big space right there? With Wordperfect you can. You can make really intricate charts without having to really learn how to do stuff...it is just really much more intuitive than Word. Plus, with ""reveal codes"" (which I ALWAYS have turned on) you can see exactly where a font change or tab or hard return or  manual kerning or whatever actually begins or ends. I have even changed the font on one single character in seconds. I couldn't be more happy with wordperfect.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,0
"You know how a cat has a tendency to turn around and shove his ass in your face while you pet him?  Buy a new computer, and the manufacturers and Microsoft puts their ass in your face by making you contend with windows 8.  Even better?  Go out and spend more money trying to install Windows 7, and they change the partitioning to make that a bigger pain in the neck.  I wish Bill Gates would put down the condoms and mosquito nets long enough to turn this company around.

I got excited when they announced they were going to make the Surface.  Then they released the Surface RT and screwed over millions and left a bad taste in the public mouth.  The Surface Pro, the only option that should have been made available was of course terribly overpriced, but a very capable device.  It wasn't overpriced because of the specs, but greedy execs didn't think it through.  They wanted to make their full price on the OS, the device, and the office package.  They didn't consider the idea of entering the marketplace first with a capable and usable device with a decent price.  Nope, they broke out of the gates pricing themselves into oblivion, and making headlines with how many went unsold.

Windows 8 is an abortion.  It is the single largest factor in a stall of device sales throughout an entire industry, but they have yet to flinch.  They will charge full steam ahead into the iceberg, driving an otherwise amazing company (yes, I was actually a Microsoft fanboy) into the bottom of the proverbial sea.

"Test System: PowerMac G4 AGP 400 MHz with 896 MB RAM and a Radeon 8500
OS: Mac OS 10.2.3 (build 6G30)
While Britannica 2003 runs on OS X, it is not truly native.  Rather, it is a Java based application designed on the Windows platform.  Java is cross-platform, but without some minor changes to optimize an application for the Mac the experience may be poor.  Unfortunately, Brtiannica did not make that effort... and it shows.
Installation was a hassle.  The first installation program you see (and the one the readme tells you to use) fails, you have to open the folder ""Extract"" then ""MacOSX"" to find a working one.  The full install requires that you switch CDs midway and ejects the first disk, but fails to unmount it in the Finder.  It also ejects the second disk when finished without unmounting.  The installer suffered an unexpected quit as it finished too.  Attempting to unmount the ghost disk icons hangs the Finder and requires a relaunch (not a restart).
The application took 19 seconds to load, but once loaded performance was generally acceptable.  Slower than a native application, but faster than a broadband internet connection and this is on a 3 year old computer, albeit with lots of RAM.
Unfortunately, the interface is completely non-Macintosh.  The menu bar is not utilized, instead File, Edit, etc. are stuck in the application.  ""Britannica Help"" under the Help menu does not work.  Additionally, key equivalents are still mapped for Windows, so some standard command-key combination won't work and control instead of command must be used for those that do.  These are serious oversights and violate Apple's interface guidelines.
Rather than letting the OS draw the windows, Britannica decided to create it's own windowing system within the application, complete with desktop.  This system is inferior both functionally and graphically to Aqua.  Additionally, this means the application's window takes almost the whole screen and is not resizable.  This makes working with multiple applications needlessly cumbersome.
While text can be cut and paste into other applications, pictures and multimedia cannot.  This needlessly restricts content when working on a report in anything but the limited sub-application Research Organizer.
Searching is decent, but is not very forgiving with spelling.  A spell check button is available that opens an application modal dialog with pull down menus of suggested replacement words for each one you entered.  But it isn't that good for spell checking.  For instance, typing ""attak"" gives you attack, but also 90 other seemingly random words covering the gamut between ""Athos"" and ""wadi.""
The Knowledge Navigator has potential to be a useful search/browse tool but, like much of the interface, is poorly implemented.  It is a data association program which starts with a ring of 10 topics.  Clicking on one moves it to the center and surrounds it with up to ten related topics, this can be repeated to refine a search or simply browse ideas.  Unfortunately, the designer decided that it needed each topic needs to float out from the central one and individually take its place in the ring.  The effect is up to 17 seconds of animation each time you change topics.  The eye-candy gets old real fast when it interferes with your work.
The interactive timeline is a nice feature that lets you view key events in 14 subjects chronologically and provides links to more information.  It took 8 seconds to load, but (much more aggravating) 10 seconds simply to view all timeline subjects you may select by scrolling through a list at the bottom at a fixed, sedate speed.
The Atlas is similar to a globe in detail.  Maps only go to the country level with more detailed maps for US states and the occasional random area.  Clicking on major cities and regions gives a brief article.
The program includes Merriam-Websters Collegiate Dictionary and Thesaurus, but their entries are accessible only through the main encyclopedia search, no separate applications.
The text of the encyclopedia itself seems good.  Multimedia is weak.  There are only 55 Quicktime files, most fewer than 20 seconds and only one exceeding one minute.  Some of the video is poor in quality and the typical resolution is only 160x120 for video and 320x240 for animations.  Additional multimedia content on Britannica's website is oddly available only in Windows Media or Real Player format.
This encyclopedia does have some good information and, despite it's many flaws, may offer you more rapid access to some reliable material than the internet.  However, the interface is very poor and non-standard and may prove frustrating.  With a little bit of effort Britannica could have made this a far better Macintosh product.  It is not horribly expensive, but I would be inclined to pass on it.  World Book 2003 Mac OS X - Jaguar Edition is the competing encyclopedia for the Macintosh OS X and, while more expensive, is probably worth a look.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0

"I have used turbo tax for over 10 years and really like the product, until last year.  My wife owns farmland in a state we no longer live in.  For 4 years we were not declaring taxes in that state become turbo tax did not indicate we needed to. Instead, we were declaring taxes for the state in which we live.  This past year turbo tax prompted us that we needed to pay tax on our income in the second state as well.  I ended up having to re-file my taxes in both states for the past 4 years.  I used a CPA to do this.  Now it would have been a wash since I could have deducted the taxes paid to another state but I ended up having to pay about $500 in interest and penalties.  I guess the bottom line is: you don't know what you don't know, and if you don't have somebody who does know (or a program), mistakes will be made.

"I hate this version.  I purchased this version for burning picture slide DVDs and burning music CDs.  Well, for burning picture slide DVDs this version is a ripoff.  This version does not let you edit your pictures once you've lined them up to burn them.  Also, this part was what took the cake for me.  Adding transitions to my picture slide DVD made me very upset because this version shows me a huge listing of transitions only not to allow me to use them.  I clicked one of the many transitions and it displays a huge message saying that I don't have the transition pack and automatically takes me to the page where I can buy Nero Classic 2015 which is what I have.  As for burning music CDs, that task too is problematic.  The choice for burning CDs the ones you can play on your regular DVD players, this Nero Classic version gives choices only if you want to burn the CD as Jukebox version which will only play on your computer and not on traditional CD players.  Then, burning as MP3 music files, Nero Classic burns the MP3 files on CDs but when I tried playing these, again these would only play on my computer and not on my MP3 boombox.  My boombox plays both traditional music files and MP3 files.  So you see, I'm very upset with Nero.  And to top it, I looked up how to contact them for help.  I found out that they charge $1.29 to help me on the telephone.  Really?  I never expected to have such a hard time with this Nero Classic 2015 software.  I mean, I'm not a computer geek but I always thought I could figure things out on my own.  I mean, I had a previous Nero version for a long time and that version did everything for me.  I loved it.  This is why I purchased this Classic 2015 version because I thought it would be everything I had before in my previous version plus more options.  I was WRONG!  I ended up with more limitations than with any software I had ever worked with.  SO, BEWARE IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS NERO CLASSIC 2015.  UNLESS YOU'VE ALREADY PLAYED WITH THIS VERSION BEFORE AT A FRIENDS HOUSE, STAY AWAY FROM IT OTHERWISE, YOU'LL BE FRUSTRATED AND UPSET LIKE I AM.

"Let me start off by saying that I am a native English speaker, and I am also an ESL teacher.  I purchased this program so that I could use it to supplement my classes and give my students some extra practice.  It has its  up points and down points.  Let me explain what I think of this program  from a teacher's point of view.  THE GOOD: 1) Like other ""Learn to  Speak"" titles I would have to say that its strongest point is helping  students learn vocabulary and pronunciation.  It has some good vocabulary  lists, a gauge that allows students to see how their recorded pronunciation  compares to a native speaker, and wonderful simulated conversations that  allow learners to practice English in a very life like manner.  2) It has  several cultural movies about cities in the United States.  They are very  enjoyable and teach students about geography, history and U.S. culture  while allowing them to practice their listening skills.  3) If students  want to study something other than the lessons included on the four CDs,  they can download additional lessons from the Internet.  It is very easy to  do, takes about ten minutes, and there are several topics to choose from.  THE BAD: 1) The dictionary is good for nothing except helping students to  pronounce words.  Since this program is entirely in English, there is no  translation for the words.  It really is quite a useless dictionary!  2)  You can't print anything!  I thought it would be nice to print out the  words and expressions so that students could take them home to practice  them, but alas, you cannot.  3) The program (including instructions) is  entirely in English.  Don't get me wrong, there are many benefits to this,  but if a student is using this for self-study I don't think they will get  far before tiring of trying to understand all the English instructions.  (For Spanish speakers I would suggest ""Hablemos Ingles"" from this  same company.)  4) This program really is for lower level learners (first  and second year.)  My advanced students enjoyed the cultural movies, and  found the simulated conversations novel, but the rest wasn't helpful to  them.  5) If you already have version 7.0, then don't bother upgrading to  this one.  Only the simulated conversations are better.  The movies and  lessons seem to be the same - only organized a bit differently and in a  more confusing manner.  OVERALL:  This is a good program if being used to  supplement a current course or to give learners extra practice.  I wouldn't  recommend it for self-study because lower level students might have a hard  time with the English instructions, and more advanced students would find  it too easy.  Definitely don't upgrade from version 7.0!  If you are  thinking about getting this program I would actually recommend that you get  version 7.0 - you can find it for a much cheaper price, it is very nearly  the same and it is organized better.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,1

"Microsoft continues to shield attacks about Vista, though many are based on heresay and preconceived notions of the MSFT culture.  If you sit down and give Vista a try, and if you get a new PC anywhere anymore you probably don't have a choice, you might not have any complaints.

First of all, a lot of the early reports of bugs in the program have been addressed and fixed in SP1, so users should not rely on what their friends have told them about Vista...as the ONLY source of information.

Secondly, my thoughts are based on my experience in Windows.  I will admit that I am an avid PC user and tend to be a little more friendly to MSFT than some other people because I am very comfortable in the Windows environment.  But with that said, Vista showcases Microsoft's worst innovative technique.  With each release of Windows or Office, Microsoft has been trying to make the user experience easier.  They say, ""We know what you are doing so we will go ahead and do it for you.""  And often times they are wrong.  They are taking some of the organization away and making things hard to find and displaying what some algorithm assumes you were looking for.  And I wish Microsoft would stop doing this.

I prefer Windows to MacOS.  I like that things follow a simple organizational pattern and everything can be neatly put away in Windows.  But don't worry, it's still there, you just have to wade through some new Vista flare to get there.

And that is my biggest gripe with Vista.  Rather than keeping the ease of use that Windows XP has and just beefing up other areas, the company seems to have opted instead for making Vista a mutated product.  I wish they would eliminate some of the confusion and just call it Microsoft Vista and remove Windows from the product name.

I'll adjust to it like anything else and before long Vista will be the new standard.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0

"I purchased iDevice Magic Platinum as I was frustrated by the limitations of iTunes. However, this product makes iTunes look very professional indeed.

I am running Windows 7 64bit and my iOS devices are on iOS7.0.3. I used this program only with my iPhone 4S as there was no way I was going to connect any other device after this experience!

The first thing after installation this morning was to tell me that there was an update. I had just put in the long, complex serial number and registered it online. I downloaded the new version to find that I had to put the serial number in again and register again. It then kept crashing, so I logged off and rebooted my PC. After that I launched it again and once again had to put in the serial number and register a third time! After that it seemed to keep it. However, nothing seems to work correctly with the program. I decided to make a ringtone, so went through the procedure and hey presto a ring tone shows up against my phone, but it is nowhere to be found on the phone itself. I found an option which appeared to let me copy it to the phone, but it still was not there.

Next, I thought I would back up my photos to the computer. What photos? Despite having hundreds of photos on the phone in the camera roll, iDevice Magic refused to display any at all. No photos, no photo albums, NOTHING!

Next was the fact that as I don't use an administrator account all the time on my machine, it set up all the default storage spaces for me in the Admin account instead of the account I was using and refused to change them! OK, so I thought ""I've had enough of this!"" I rebooted the PC and then fired up iTunes. iTunes promptly told me that it could not read the configuration information from my phone. Presumably it had been corrupted by iDevice Magic. iTunes told me that I had to do a retore from the summary screen. This is not just a restore from backup, it means back to factory default config! This means downloading and installing iOS7.0.3 from scratch and then restoring all my data from a backup! Luckily, I backed the phone up immediately before installing iDevice Magic.

So now, thanks to this product screwing my iPhone completely, I am sitting waiting for many hours for all my contacts, 85 apps, 7760 music files, plus, photos, videos, etc to be restored to my phone.

Not an experience that would make me recommend this product to anyone. In fact, I would advise people to steer well clear of it! I've just called the vendor and got a full refund.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,1

"Finally, Microsoft gets it.  Windows 8 is a transitional operating system in a lot of ways.  It may be slow to be adopted, but once touch screens become the norm I believe it will help complete the transition for the PC to move into new territory, the same thing Apple has been pioneering for years with their products.  Of course, there will still be a need for a keyboard and mouse occasionally, but computing is moving into a new era of freedom with mobility and touch screens.  Interfaces are being simplified but as evidenced with iPad apps, the creativity, versatility and fun has increased.  Now, with Windows 8, we get a glimpse of the future with the Metro UI and classic Windows desktop combined into a simplified interface.  In a matter of minutes I was switching back and forth between the Start screen and the desktop.. and finally there's a real use for the START key, which I've never used before until now.

I noticed immediately, the OS has been streamlined.  Where Windows 7 feels like a monster, Windows 8 feels like all the fat has been trimmed, giving more horsepower under the hood.  You will notice a big performance boost.  Gone are the unnecessary menus, replaced with a few simple options.  Basically what they've done is transformed Windows into something it should've been years ago.

I found that there was only a handful of software compatibility issues, which weren't a big issue since I didn't use them regularly anyway.  I think you'll find most software will remain compatible with the new OS.  Microsoft has a list on their site you can use to verify.

As with previous Windows upgrades the sound card (SB X-Fi Xtreme Gamer) wasn't recognized, but I was able to install the latest SB beta drivers and get sound up and going within minutes, after a reboot.

I've only been using it for a couple hours, but I am impressed with the new direction.  A lot of people might scoff at the changes, but you have to consider that Windows hasn't changed that much in the last 15 years.  People won't want to adopt a new platform easily.  I believe that Microsoft has a real winner with this new OS.  It's transitional in that it uses two interfaces, the desktop and Metro, so what I would look for is for future OS's to move more toward weaning people off of their peripherals and embracing touch screen technology for their computing needs.

The performance boost alone is well worth the upgrade to Windows 8.  You won't believe the difference.  Microsoft wins in a big way and I hope they continue in this direction, it's the future of computing.

UPDATE 11/14/12
*Windows has native support for ISO files, but when burning a bootable ISO, it sticks the ISO contents in a subfolder on the CD rather than writing the ISO as it was originally intended, thus I burned a disc I couldn't use because all of the contents were in a dated subfolder.  You would think in this day and age Microsoft would have added in common-sense support for various file types, so that their operating system would be the most inclusive and innovative, but it seems Microsoft still has a long way to go in OS design and common-sense.
*There is no shutdown button on the desktop.  You have to log yourself out, then shut down.  There is a workaround to add a button to the desktop and the Start page, but you shouldn't have to do this.  More lack of common sense in design of a new OS and its interface.
*SkyDrive appears to cause crashes in a key piece of software I use when I go to upload a file to a server.  So either I disable SkyDrive or I can't upload to files like I need to.  Good thing I'm not using SkyDrive at the moment, but what if I wanted to?  Yet another thing you have to use regedit to fix.
*I'm 3 weeks in, using Windows 8, and I'm starting to see that there really isn't a reason to upgrade from Windows 7, unless you want the extra bells and whistles.  Just keep in mind this is a transitioning operating system and the interface has done away with things you're used to.
*I did the upgrade on two PC's, keeping my files but deleting the old OS (Windows 7).  When I was done I was pleasantly surprised to see some apps stayed on my desktop and ran fine, as well as my Windows Live Mail, which after a new install had all of my previous mail settings and loaded up without a need for configuration.

In all, it's open to interpretation.  Microsoft continues to release OS's with features and design that beg the question ""What were they thinking?"" or ""Why didn't they think of this/that; go the extra mile?"".  The other thing I don't like and Windows 8 is the Start page is chock full of Microsoft services powered by Bing.  I don't use Bing for anything.  It would be nice to be able to customize those features with ones I want.  Maybe we'll see that as the OS matures.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,1

"If you are a current Quicken user faced with a forced upgrade, version 2010 is better than at least, 2007.  upgrade only when necessary.  My upgrades this decade were in 2004 and 2007.

As a heavy user since 1988, I've seen a lot change with Quicken, many have been painful.  Versions this decade are the least problematic.  Periodic upgrades do make sense given its Internet centric operation because HTML, encryption, security protocols, and more, have evolved much and Quicken must adopt these changes.  Alas, to users most of these are invisible and behind the scenes.  In 2010, Quicken now uses the .NET framework for coding, a mixed blessing, as it consumes more memory, resources and disk space to add capability and stability.  Computers should find these added needs inconsequential if these machines run games and 720p movies easily.  I've not had problems with data syncing, slow response, bugs, lost data, corrupt files etc., despite my 4 year old computer and continuous data going back to 1985.

I've never upgraded to a first release of a new version to avoid bugs, nor overwrite a prior version.  Always make a full system backup before installation, a system restore point just before installation, then a fresh install, then import the prior data file as a copy, keeping the old file intact.  This leads to the least, if not problem free upgrade and an effortless path back to the old version should the upgrade bomb.  Although I received 2010 Release 1.0, online files were available to upgrade my 2010 to Release 4.0.

The GUI design has remain unchanged, and clearly noticeable improvements and editing aids are welcome, BUT not worth paying for.

Quicken does make effortless a core function of personal finance, quick retrieval and reliable storage of data, editing and later analysis via reports.  In the past decade, data retrieval has been nearly flawless; duplicate entries are increasingly rare even if you overlap a data set, say after syncing manually then later add data using a QFX file.  However, Quicken has many shortcomings that should have been fixed decades ago.  Quicken has  sub-optimally organized or thought out functions. Its not intuitive where a function is, several do the same thing or are poorly thought out.  For example, there are 3 ways to write electronic checks that do the same thing differently: through a 1990s ""online banking"" interface, the checking register, or a separate checkbook app.  Attachments to register entries, such as jpgs of checks, can be encrypted individually, however you can see the files whether encrypted or not, the annunciator is poorly located so its not immediately clear if attachments are encrypted, and this option implies Quicken data files are not encrypted entirely, a serious oversight.  There is also suggestion from Elcomsoft, that a backdoor exists for decoding Quicken data file passwords.  Luckily, one can separately encrypt files or drive partitions using Windows options or 3rd party programs.

The new user or light Quicken user should know there are several free personal finance managers available for download that read Quicken formats.  I've tried some of them but they lack Quicken's overall flexibility, and they are similar to early versions of Quicken. Thus, if your needs are simple like budgeting, then tracking income, expense and some investing, there maybe free alternatives.  Should you decide to move to Quicken later, these programs allow exports into the Quicken format.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,0
"A software publisher like Intuit can't leave well enough alone. They'd go out of business if they did that, so they keep releasing new versions of products that have already reached perfection or something close to it. Or, as is the case with Quicken, the older versions simply worked.

  Now I finally got around to upgrading to Quicken Home & Business 2007. It runs without crashing - but most of the new features seem to be advertising for Intuit products and services.

  What used to be transparent features, such as downloading credit card transactions and importing them into your accounts is given a fancy name (""web connect"") and obfuscated. Try looking up ""qfx"" file in the Quicken Help system. Nothing really useful. Try looking up ""importing credit card data"" and you get hundreds of results. It appears that they scooped up everything from their online forums and dumped into their help file. It doesn't work well.

  I finally found the answer I needed: don't fix it if it ain't broken. Once I thoroughly learn this version of Quicken, I will not update again until there is absolutely no choice. If anything, either Intuit should bring out a version with fewer ""features"" or someone should seize the market opportunity for a product that simply works.

The other complaint is that when you ask to reconcile a brokerage account that doesn't have a matching cash account, the program defaults to today's date as the date of the statement.

If you are ok with these limitations or already have a full vocaloid 3 editor then buying this software may be good deal for you.

"Let me start by saying that I rely on Dragon dictate for 98% of the typing I do on my computer. I have visual problems as well as nerve damage in my right-hand that prevents me from typing anything more than short sentences. As I said, sometimes this program works great. If you install it correctly, train it properly and use it as recommended, in a QUIET room, you will get amazing results. At least for a time. I spend hours and hours writing and I frequently find myself restarting program and even when it works""Correctly"", I find myself having to use the"" purge cache"" command every few paragraphs or so. Nonetheless, I was relatively happy with this program UNTIL it stopped opening my status window. No matter what I tried to do, (deleting the .plist, etc) I could not find a fix for this problem. If you are not familiar with this program, the status window is basically what you use to control the program alongside your voice. The Nuance webpage is not really much help at all. I scoured the Internet and found people with the same problem as I don't have some success doing a total reinstall of the program. I knew this could be problematic because I actually bought A CD copy of the program in version 2.5 and then updated to 3.0 when OS X mountain lion broke 2.5. My mistake was updating via download from the website. The download costs the same much as physical media but I was rushed for time because I had a deadline. This was a little more than a year ago and like I said, it worked in a semi-satisfactory manner until I encountered this issue with the status window. My hesitation in reinstalling was due to the fact that nuance make this process so painful the last time. But I was out of options because in addition to not displaying the status window, the program was crashing with every use. I held my breath and deleted the application and then looked up my order number which I entered into the website to download A new copy of the application that I had already paid for only to be brought to a page that said I couldn't download the program again, because I was out of my 30 DAY WINDOW to do so. 30 days! What happened to standing behind your product? As it is, I already had to buy the program TWICE because of compatibility issues with newer versions of OS X, which I believe is ridiculous enough. Now I have to buy it for a THIRD time because it was defective. I feel this company can run their business this way because they make A product that people have to buy. There is no viable alternative. Without good dictating software, my computer is worthless to me. So they know they can hold their customers hostage. No matter how unfair their business practices are,  a portion of their customer base will have to shell out any amount of money to buy their products. It would be akin to have a single wheelchair manufacturer who could charge whatever they wanted. In case you hunk I am being melodramatic, let me remind you it is an ASSISTIVE DEVICE.It says so right in OS X. I think you are only covered for customer support during that same 30 days, after which point, you have to pay to speak with tech support. By the minute, I might add. In case you think this review crosses the line because it is not solely about the product itself, let me say that I disagree because the product is more than just lines of code or a piece of plastic, it is the experience of using it.

"I have been a loyal Quicken fan for years. Used to love it. My wife wanted to use Personal Capital, but stubbornly I wanted to stick with Quicken and purchased the new version. What a mistake. I have tried it since the start of 2016 and I just can't anymore. I have way too many lost hours to this program just fixing transactions and dealing with bugs and crashes. I'm amazed really at the poor quality. This program is beyond buggy. It hangs on entering and saving transactions, frequently crashes, and downloads duplicate transactions on a regular basis. This means you have to go in and manually delete the duplicates one by one. Customer service is almost non-existent. Another issue is Quicken now lags severely behind other options, such as Personal Capital. In Quicken I had to manually enter my Lending Club account, Thrift Savings Plan account, and Interactive Brokers account. Personal Capital has support for all. I'm not sure what happened and if its the result of Intuit being sold, but Quicken is no longer even in the top five of financial software. I will never purchase an Intuit product again. Sad really, as a good desktop financial software package is all I want. But Quicken 2016 honestly just isn't even functional at this point.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0
"First off, its important to point out that DeLorme products are functional, accurate and offer comprehensive tools for what they do.  What boggles my mind is that the company has continued to evolve their product using a near DOS-based interface.  Nothing about Street Atlas USA is intuitive in the Windows sense of the word - there are no pulldown menus with familiar headings that might lead a user into a more logical sequence of tools or user options.  Everything is laid out in the workspace with switches and overlapping options that are OFTEN difficult to grasp - frankly, aside from the lush graphics that are the maps, the rest of the program layout looks remarkably ""1996"".  There has been no noticable innovation in user friendliness of the product in years, and apparently no movement to migrate the productline into the Windows (or Mac) realm.

"I found Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7 relatively easy to learn and use, and I had no issues with installation either. My last version of this software was version X3, and I certainly did find this version to be quite a bit faster, and the user interface to be quite a bit better. This latest version boasts several performance improvements over previous versions, and it also has an even longer list of editing tools. Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7 is an efficient and comprehensive video editing program that has more than enough features and video editing capabilities for the average user.

One reason I got this new version is because it allows me to produce next generation 4K videos and Blu-ray videos. And while that may not be important to you right now, it likely will be in the not too distant future. But the main reason I got this new version is for the 64-bit high-end Special FX Pack, the really great slideshow maker, and the much faster video rendering. This software is designed to take advantage of more computing power if your computer has it available. My computer does in fact have quite a bit of muscle, and I did find this version of this software to be faster. It's certainly not ""WOW"" faster, but quite noticeably faster. However, if your computer is lacking in the muscle department, you likely won't notice much of a difference in rendering speeds, so do take that into account.

Something else I wanted to mention is that I own several other video editing programs, and while their specs are the same as Corel's, for some reason Corel's rendered output just plain looks better. I don't know why, but it does. And not just a little bit better either. It's significantly better. After you finish your project, what you see onscreen is significantly clearer and smoother. This, of course, isn't a minor thing, this is a major thing, and this tells me that Corel's software is definitely doing something differently, something much better than what their competitor's software is doing. So, while there are other video editing programs that certainly have more bells and whistles than Corel's, if the quality of the finished product is the most important thing to you, do take Corel's top quality output into account.

Now, like I said, my last version of the software was version X3, and while all the improvements to this latest version are really terrific, what makes this newest version a real winner is the fact that it's still very affordable. Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7 is a great set of tools at a great price. A bargain really. You get a lot of bang for your video editing buck. It contains all the tools you need to make really great videos. I recommend this latest version highly. I hope you found this review helpful.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,1
"I have been using Quicken for over 20 years, and generally like it. I recently upgraded, and this version is HORRIBLE. I used to be able to input transactions very quickly and easily. They have made it laborious and buggy.

When I installed the upgrade, it a) combined two entirely separate accounts, my personal financial account and the financial records for a small business I am keeping books for, into one account. This is disastrous---we are COMPLETELY separate entities and our financial records should NOT be comingled. b) For some reason, when I open Quicken now, it shows 3 versions of most of my accounts. I had to delete the superfluous ones by hand. And, it won't let me make adjustments on some accounts.

The new Quicken is AWFUL. If I could, I would uninstall it, toss it in the trash, and go back to my old version. Unfortunately, my new computer requires the upgraded version. This is so bad that after 20+ years, I may be switching financial record keeping programs altogether.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0

"I was very pleased with this software.  Most everything positive as far as a new operating system for me.  The software came in a factory sealed plastic DVD case.  There are two DVD's inside, one for 32-bit, and one for 64-bit.  The Windows key (needed to activate and receive updates) is printed right inside the plastic case.  You can either do a clean install (in which case your old operating system is saved in a file on the hard drive) or you can upgrade.

It is a full copy of the entire Windows 7 operating system including Service Pack 1.  As of this point in time there are only two unrecognized components in the device manager.  I would say that Microsoft has done a very good job on this Operating System.

I would trust this seller, as the item I purchased is exactly as advertised.  If you are looking for Windows 7, this is the place to purchase it.  I did a bit of research on pricing (nothing truly extensive) but from what I saw, many sellers/retailers were asking $200 and up for this product.

So do your research and decide for yourself.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,1
"I hadn't used Quicken for a few years and was feeling like my financial life was getting away from me.  It was good to get things back in order.  Intuit is trying to balance the graphical expectations of users with performance and has yet to strike an optimal balance.  In fairness, my desktop PC is a bit on the old side, but it is not wimpy.  Sometimes Quicken can take 10-20 seconds just to save a transaction as it updates all the related accounts and windows on the screen.  However, it works for me.  I like how Intuit has done integrations with some financial institutions.  With my credit union, for example, I can initiate a transfer from within Quicken and execute it automatically without having to go to the website.  I can't imagine going back to not knowing what's up with my financial life, and Quicken is the only tool I've used that has given me the understanding I need.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,1

It's 5:00am Saturday 02/27/2016 and I was trying to get into my check register.
I entered my password as usual (no I didn't mistype it) and received this message from the Quicken app
""Lets Make Sure It's You"" telling me that they are sending me a email with a code to verify my info.
It looks like they have the correct email but the email never arrives.
Therefore, I never get the code to enter so I can get to my check register.

"Less than a month ago I was a little bit hesitant about getting Vista thinking that it was going to be another cash grab with minor useless additions - boy was I wrong.  Let me tell you what changed my mind:

1)  Computer and Media are finally integrated.  The Mediacentre allows you to nicely store all of your CD's in a neat & organized way.  With the proper equipment you may be able to record and watch tv or output straight into your tv. THIS IS THE FUTURE!

2)  The graphics are superb!

4,5,6,7...) I won't repeat the rest of the good reviews but they are true - no hype.

I'm sorry to tell you this but I highly suggest that you buy a new computer with a lot of memory and a lot of speed, so you don't have any headaches.

This develops prereading skills and following directions. There are other activities: Coloring, matching, puzzles and a sticker type activity. All the activities inspire creativity and other skills such as pre reading skills, following directions, and more. Further there are print up activities you can print up and do in your own home. What a great idea.

"Painter occupies a very particular niche in the world of digital imaging software. Though the latest versions of Photoshop sport an excellent brush tool and ample brush controls, there is nothing to match the power and possibilities of Painter's brush creator. And Painter is truly unique in its emulation of natural media, ranging from thick impasto strokes to naturally drying watercolor, and oil paints that stay wet as long as you please. There is a mixer palette which works exactly like an actual one: new colors can be mixed on the fly as if mixing actual pigments rather than colored pixels. Of course, the digital environment also offers possibilities not available in the real world, and apart from the natural media Painter therefore offers a whole array of fantasy and pattern brushes, as well as distortion filters and blender. As all these can be adjusted and turned into new brushes according to taste, the possibilities are truly limitless. Layering options are numerous, and come with an array of blending methods more extensive than that in PS. Selection possibilities are excellent too, with highly accessible options for saving and reloading particular complex selections. There are some nice filters as well, including a particularly fine bevel tool that allows detailed control of complex bevels. There are, of course, many plug-ins available that can be added according to budget and taste, such as the KPT filters. Painter includes the usual vector pen and shape options, which are excellent for making precise selections or creating smooth shapes.

This is, as the name suggests, a painting program. It is not primarily an image editor. It can be used a such, but obviously yields to Photoshop in that regard. It appeals strongly to  the individual creativity of the user, and can be inspiring to work with. If you are familiar with PS, you'll have to get used to the Painter interface, which puts similar functions in different places than PS. There are some nifty solutions, such as the possibility of creating a custom box of drawing tools: simply drag the thumbnail of the desired brush into the work area. On the other hand, some options on offer seem superfluous or even confusing. E.g., the ""paint outside""/""paint inside""/""paint everywhere"" switch achieves something just as easily done by inverting or discarding a selection. As usual with such high end programs, the array of options is apt to make for a cluttered workspace. Fortunately, palettes are all floatable and collapsible.

Downsides? Well, yes. Apparently recent versions of Painter have gained speed compared to earlier ones, but the program still seems to have some serious memory management issues. On my PC (1.6Ghz P4, 1Gb RAM, 250 GB harddisk, nVidia GeForce FX 5950 256 MB videocard, Windows XP Home SP1), routine operations like loading a selection or changing the zoom level, and even saving, regularly lead to program freezes that can last for some time (as in: go downstairs, make yourself a cup of coffee), though on the plus side I've experienced no actual crashes. Some brush types also tend to be excruciatingly slow to respond, especially with large brush sizes, which rather detracts from the natural painting feel.

Still, Painter remains a more than worthwhile addition to any collection of digital imaging tools. Make sure you also have a drawing tablet, or you will not reap the full benefits of Painters possibilities.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,1

"It worked fine for me the between the time I Purchased it (April 26, 2016) all the way up until November 20, 2016. It suggested that I do the update for the program in November, and I did. Although, after that update, I've not been able to successfully access the program ever since. IT ALWAYS CRASHES every single time I try to update my financial information, or anything else. Or if I click on another program and switch back to Quicken, IT CRASHES!!!! Without fail!!!! It's beyond infuriating, and I will reach out to Quicken to see what they may be able to do about that.

"I was offered an upgrade from the last version to this and it was the worst decision. First there was no Spam filter (one of the main purposes of having the product installed) and this had to be downloaded separately. Next the Spam filter worked for a day or 2 and then stopped. So I contact the support desk who recommend reinstallation. I try this, then nothing. So I try support again and they totally misunderstand the problem and send me some nonsense that doesn't work. So I became frustrated and email them every few days reminding them it doesn't work and I'm not happy. Today I wrote them an email and said I want my money back as a) the software clearly doesn't work (you only need to read the comments here to understand that),and b) their support people are unhelpful and unresponsive.

"This has to be the most disappointing Norton product I've bought. Norton Antivirus etc are great - but this product has been a disaster, and I've had to turn it off to make email usable.
Echoing another review on this site, Antispam was good for about a week. Then things started going wrong. Email download became very slow - emails apparently were queueing up to the spam analysis process, and nothing was appearing in the Inbox or the Spam folder. Breaking out of this appears to have meant lose emails.
A couple of weeks later, Outlook started spewing ""Not enough memory to display this [message/reminder/window/whatever]"" errors. I couldn't even list the email in my Inbox, let alone open them. My RAM is fine - and amazingly enough, as soon as I disabled antispam, the error went. I also spent some time with the wonderful ""Outlook crashes when you click the 'This is Spam' button"" bug. Quality - although allegedly now fixed.
I've had enough of this product. I'm an experienced Windows user with an MCSE, and my system runs well - with the exception of Antispam. I won't be looking out for Antispam2005, I can tell you. Based on my experience, my advice is ""Stay well clear"".

"I have investment accounts through multiple financial institutions and purchased this software in hopes of organizing everything into one neat little package.  I got hung up on my first account with Quicken. The institution where my account is held only provided the last 90 days of transactions for direct import into quicken. ""No problem"", I thought, I'll just go to the institution's website, download the entire account history to an excel file or whatever format they provide and import that into Quicken. So, my institution (one of the larger online brokerages) only provides data in a csv file, which for those who aren't familiar with it, is a very simple data file, easily opened in excel or notepad or just about any software program, except Quicken.

I spent an entire afternoon trying to figure out how to import this simple file and then started scanning through the Quicken help files about the issue and found out that Quicken, in all it's high-tech glory, cannot import a simple csv file.  Furthermore, there appears to be third party software writer's who have written programs to convert csv or excel files to Quicken's file format for import.  Which of these are legit or people trying to steal personal information, I don't know.  Why Quicken would not include at least a format converter as part of their software is beyond me.

I think if you're in the business of writing money management software you had better make sure your program can import ALL types of files used by the all financial institutions.  And if your software can't import the simplest of data files, then it has some serious shortcomings.

Before purchasing this software, I would make sure your financial institution(s) provide your data in a format Quicken can import.  Otherwise you're wasting your money.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0

"Punch Home Design Platinum can do some wonderful things in home design and landscaping
if it is on the right computer. For all those who rated Punch Home Design Platinum as a 1 or 2, it
is probably your computer that is giving you poor results. You must have it installed on the right
computer. Best used computers to have it on would have the XP Microsoft operating system. On IBM and
Dell computers built between 1995 and 2004 you want to have at least 512 megabytes to 1,000 megabytes
(1 gigabyte) RAM storage. Most computers you bought during that time had 256 megabytes of RAM, so you
need to buy larger or additional RAM memory cards to have good results running the Punch Home design
program. The best kind of RAM memory card to get is called DRAM memory because your graphic programs
will run twice as fast with DRAM memory compared to RAM memory.
 I taught students Architectural Drafting for 6 years using the Punch Home Platinum Design program.
The student that turn out wonderful design with the program had previous art course in graphic design
using computers, and also had art courses on proper selection of different color schemes and patterns.
Punch Home can't do everything, and in the next section of this review, I will get into what it can do and can't do. First
and, foremost you must have it running on the right computer to get good results.

What Punch Home can do and can't do. (The can do and can't do list didn't come out posted as type in so I number them
for the intended order of posting by me.)
 Can Do: 1.) You can develop a set of blueprints stored on your computer.
 Can't Do: 2.) You can't print out a set of blueprints that you can file with a city building department.
  This  feature is generally included in the most expensive or professional version.
 Can Do: 3.) You can draw different styles and types of houses such as ranch homes, colonial homes,
  split-level houses, and houses up to 3 stories high.
 Can't Do: 4.) Doesn't do a good job drawing a English Tudor style of housing.
 Can Do: 5.) If you are drawing a house which has an exterior of brick and siding and a hip roof, this
  is very easy to do with Punch Home. You can have a hip roof with dormers using Punch Home.
  The first time you do dormers on a roof, you are probably not going to get it right. But once
  you are shown, or learn how to do it, it isn't too hard.

  6.) A house exterior of brick, siding, and a gable roof can be done, but it is a little more work.
  You are probably not going to get the gable side walls done right the first time. The procedure
  is included in the instruction book you received with the software, or you can read the instructions
  online using the help command. You generally want the floor plan and a 3-dimensional view open
  at the same time. You double click on the gable wall of the floor plan to open a dialog box. In this
  dialog box, you type in your changes. When you hit return, you watch your changes take place in
  your 3-dimensional view. Many students needed to be shown how to do this even after reading the
  instructions. Most students with previous computer aided graphic design from an art class did it
  on their own.
Can Do: 9.) Landscape plan design is very good. It shows how your landscape will look many years into the future.
  Many students really liked this part of the design program.
Can Do: 10.) Excellent for designing the layout of the kitchen cabinets, and how they look in the 3 dimensional
  drawing.
Can't Do: 7.) If you are drawing an exterior of a English Tudor style house, Punch Home isn't very good to do that
  type of exterior. In Tudor style houses, the windows are generally casement windows. Punch Home doesn't
  have a window selection for casement windows.
Can Do: 8.) It is a very useful program for matching different colors of brick, different colors of siding, and
  different colors of roofing material for your exterior of your house

Information about the ""measuring ruler"" that other posters don't seem to know how to use. The ruler for measuring
distance can be moved and turned so that you can measure distances that are vertical and horizontal on your screen.
It also can be made bigger or smaller to measure different sizes. Another way you can get the size of the object or
change the size of an object is by double clicking on the object which opens a dialog box. In the dialog box, the
size of the object is given, or if you want, you can change the size by typing in a different number.

 I rate Punch Home Design Platinum as a four (4) instead of the top rating of a five (5), for the simply reason
that another Home Design program called ""Chief Architect"" has a top end design program for $495.00 which seems to offer
more according to their tutorial video(es) than Punch Home top end design program for a professional architect or
building contractor. Dimensioning in ""Chief Architect"" seems to be rated a little more higher for accuracy than
Punch Home, and the framing drawings in ""Chief Architect"" allows for more customization than the framing drawings in Punch
Home. On the other hand you are paying $300 more dollars for ""Chief Architect"" top end program compared to
Punch Home top end home design program.

 I am going to end this review with a discussion of two signs that indicate you don't have enough RAM or DRAM memory.
1.) If the time to regenerate the drawing goes from under 5 seconds when you start doing the drawing to more than
  5 minutes to regenerate when you are putting in cabinets and furnitue into the drawing, then you don't have enough
  RAM or DRAM memory.
2.) Punch Home has four click buttons where you can look at the four side elevations in the 3-dimensional view.
  If the colored brick pattern or the colored siding pattern has blank streaks in them, it is a sign you don't
  have enough RAM/DRAM memory. As you zoom in closer to the drawing in the 3-dimensional view by using the ""walking
  command"", these blank streaks disappear. It is not a glitch in the software, your computer does not have enough
  RAM/DRAM memory to run the Punch Home Design program correctly or properly.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,0

"We tried several other Spanish learning programs before finding Tell-me-more.  My kids found a major title awkward to use and boring.  Another that I chose lacked sufficient indicators of progression.  This one is a tiny bit tricky to set-up; as it uses a computer microphone.  But, this is also the magic of the system, as it evaluates the learners responses for accuracy and prompts them to repeat the word or phrase if it is unintelligible.

The interface is a bit obtuse in a couple of places.  We had to call support early on because my oldest daughter was unable to get past a particular screen.  We learned through that call that the computer was waiting for her to say the entire phrase that made up the answer, and not just the single word that needed to be added to make the phrase complete.  The wait for support was reasonable, and the representative was knowledgeable.

This is not the least expensive language system out there.  But, others require you to purchase additional product as the learner progresses.  The edition of Tell-me-more that we purchased includes the entire coursework for a high school Spanish course of multiple years; and can be used by more than one learner at a time; reducing the effective cost per child per semester to a very reasonable price.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,0

"Purchased this for my 9 year old home schooled child. The program took a couple of tries for her to understand the flow between lesson, practice, challenges, and games, but by her 3rd day she was loving it and asking to do it outside of school time. She is now typing 12-15 words per minute from the home row plus a few other keys.

A note here: the program has settings where you choose which 'method' to have the student taught. There are no instructions, however, on what each method includes (other than the keys) and what happens when your child captures the castle at the end of that lesson set. For example, I chose the 'home row' method because I thought it sounded like the first lesson. But my daughter completed all the quests and games and captured the castle in only her 3rd week. I'm not clear on how much progression the program is providing her now that she has access to the additional games and exercises in the castle. I 'm not clear on if we need to change the setting to 'recommended' program, which will start her over in all the island areas... and if so will the games be different or the same with just additional letters included? We don't know and the tour doesn't tell you!  I have not looked to see if our download purchase included a parent manual to answer these types of questions, but they are definitely not answered in the program directly for parent or student.  The program lacks intuitiveness in the menu layout, but with a little time you figure out what goes where. There are no surprises because menu options are limited and not at all circular. So you tend to go forward somewhere then just go back where you came from. NOTE if a child attempts to return to a section they have already completed, it WILL clear their results and have them go through it all again. If does provide a warning message first, but if the child doesn't pay attention and hits okay, they will lose the results of that section by returning to it.

The quality of the challenges is great and the graphics are good, not too cheesy. There is funny stuff, goofy stuff, and cool stuff, all of which have kept my pre-teen very happy with her typing instruction. I highly recommend it for folks who are just looking to get their kid some quality exposure without having to be involved in the teaching directly.

The program gives feedback (results) to the kid, and doesn't let the progress until they pass certain speed challenges (which include accuracy requirements) so the challenge is there, but the fun is too. So it is a win-win for getting a kid to learn how to type! Note, I did catch my child reverting to 2-3 finger typing all over the board during games because she was wrapped up in winning and forgetting to 'type'. A simple reminder got her hands back on the home row.

PRO: WELL worth the small cost! Quality program with great results.
CON: a little hard to figure out the process at first",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,0

I called HP, and was told that hardly anyone uses Works anymore that's is why it's no longer available on the newer computers, and seems to becoming obsolete, which I think is bunk.  I have a lot of written material on Works, so what happens when we can no longer get Works and it becomes incompatable to the newer computers.  What then?  What were they thinking?",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,0

"I won't delve into the topic of whether Windows 10 is good or bad. That horse has already been gracefully beaten to death online.

WINDOWS 10 HOME VS PRO:
This product is Widows 10 home. There is another version - Windows 10 pro that includes additional features such as domain join, Group policy management, bitlocker, remote desktop etc. If you are using Windows 10 for casual use then you can use the Windows 10 home. You can install same applications, software and the end user experience is same on both version of Windows.

WHAT IS DOWNLOAD VERSION
There are other version available which have the Windows packaged on either CD/DVD or USB drive. The license/product key for the Windows is on the box containing the media. However, this version provides you with the license/product key and expects you to download the windows from Microsoft's website.

HOW TO INSTALL THIS VERSION
After you buy the Windows 10 you would receive an email containing the license/product key. Product key is a combination of 25 digits and characters. The email contains link to a page on instruction to redeem the purchased item. The page specifies the link on Microsoft's web-site where you can download Windows. Form that site you can download Windows Media creation Tool or Widows ISO. The media creation tool lets you create a bootable USB of Windows for installation. Whatever way you choose, the installation media will have files for installing both Home and Pro version.

You might experience one problem if you are upgrading from a Pro version of older Windows (e.g. Windows  pro or Windows 8 pro) to this Home version. After the upgrade you would find that you have Windows 10 Pro installed and the purchased license key would not work. So if you are upgrading from a Pro version you would have to perform a clean install to get Windows 10 home version. This would mean that you have to backup all data because the clean install will delete all the data on the installation drive.

When performing a clean install, you insert the media (DVD or USB drive) which contains the Windows 10 and reboot the device. Since we want the computer to boot from this media, so make sure that in the BIOS the boot-order specifies computer will try to boot from the media before the Hard disk. You would have to consult your computer's/laptop's manual to see how to set that. Usually when you boot the computer the very first screen shows the key to press to enter BiOS configuration (e.g. in my case I had to press F2 to enter BiOS configuration) As part of the installation process the computer will reboot. At this point make sure to remove the DVD/USB otherwise the installation process will begin again.

Things are really straight forward if you are upgrading from a previous Windows Home version. You can simply insert the media and click on executable file name ""setup.exe"". This will start the installation process.

HOW TO USE THE PRODUCT KEY

The product key received with this purchase would be of 25 characters (combination of numbers and alphabets.) Soon after starting the installation, Windows 10 would show a screen asking for the  product activation key. The received product key needs to  be entered there. Windows will try to validate the key at this point. If it is not able to validate the key (in case Internet connection is not yet configured or not available), even then Windows will proceed and will get installed but will not be activated.

When Windows 10 installation process asks for product key, you can also select the option ""I don't have a product key"". In this case also, Windows 10 will get installed as deactivated.

If Windows 10 is deactivated then there are couple of features disabled (such as personalization features e.g. changing wallpaper, accent color) Also there will be watermark on the desktop saying that Windows 10 is not yet activated.

You can still activate the Windows 10 by entering the product key in Settings > Update and Security > Activation screen.

IS THIS COPY OF WINDOWS GENUINE
Seems like so. Other than the fact that it worked for me without any issues, Microsoft's website also sells the download version for the same price. However, with Amazon I can use the points and get points for the purchases, so it was a little cheaper by buying using Amazon's credit card. There are numerous other web-sites that sell the digital key for the Windows 10 for anywhere $15-$40. From different experiences posted online, it seems that getting those keys to work is simply a game of luck. Some of these keys are coming from people who are selling their key for cheap (because they got it for cheap from various discounts.) Some are straight-away scams. At-least this in one is genuine and I can get support if things don't work.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,0

"Don't buy this product. Here's why: 1) it doesn't come with a manual, 2) it doesn't come with a user guide CD or DVD, 3) the software is not intuitive, and 4) the training was outsourced to Back Lot Studios. There is tutorial to walk you through basic operations like ""Cut, Copy, and Paste"". When you load this software, no symbol for a user manual comes up. That means you are forced to use a ""trial and error"" method to teach yourself the boilerplate of learning. You must bully Pinnacle/Corel into giving you a user's guide.
Trying to learn via trial and error is difficult. For example, the symbol for ""Cut"" is not a pair of scissors. Every other software system in the galaxy uses a pair of scissors as the ""cut"" symbol, but not this one. Instead, the writers of this software use a rectangle and expect you to guess that it represents a razor blade. You could spend hours trying to find the scissors symbol and you might never figure out that the ""rectangle"" was a play-pretend razor blade. It sure does not look like a razor blade. That is not an isolated problem; that's how non-intuitive this software is.
The Pinnacle experience achieves total nadir when the user finds that he has been stiffed with thirty days of ""free training"" from Back Lot Studios. The Back Lot logo pops up instead of a training manual. This is a big deal because BLS doesn't know boilerplate from fried eggs. If you asked these clowns what time it was, they would tell you how to build a watch.
Finally, there is some help on YouTube, but there is no coherent, ""start with the basics course"" for PS 18 Ultimate. I gave this software two stars because I think of it as ""number two"".
One more thing: I warned Pinnacle and Back Lot that I would trash them on Amazon if they didn't get me a manual. They didn't; so, I did. Here is what happened. They sent me a notice that an update was available for PS 18. I downloaded it and found that they had included a free manual with their update! They didn't apologize or anything like that, they just sneaked it in.
Their user's manual is a free download, but it doesn't have an icon. That means it doesn't show up when I load up. The best thing about this experienced is that I'm totally pleased that my slash and burn techniques worked with these creeps. Reviews on Amazon are read and they carry a lot of weight.

"Beware if you have an older mac.  The installer doesn't work well with older macs.  I work with Windows and UNIX and I found the installer of this product to be extremely poorly designed. I have 20+ years of system administration experience and found this to be the worst upgrade I've went through in the last 5 years. We tried to update a G4 that was running 10.3.x.  After cleaning up the disk enough to install the Leopard the install failed.  We could not come back up on 10.3 since the install had wiped out the 10.3 install.  We could not re-install 10.5 since 10.5 had installed enough of 10.5 to make the installer think there was not enough disk space.  I had to boot the system into single user mode and manually remove enough of the 10.5 installation so the installer would try the re-install. I had to do this re-install thing 5 times and still no luck.  Apple support was useless and told us we had a bad DVD.  I did a google search on our problem and found a blog from someone who had the same problem with the installer and fixed it by removing RAM from the system so that there was no more than 512 MB of ram in the system.  I removed the extra ram and the system installed the first time.  Everything than seemed to work well and I thought everything was fine.

Little did I know that when I tried to update the system to 10.5.2 that the system would become completely useless.  The update to 10.5.2 downloaded and installed but at the last step it failed.  The system wouldn't boot, didn't have enough disk space to re-install 10.5.1, couldn't boot into single user mode so the only choice was to wipe the disk and do a fresh install.

If you want to risk this upgrade backup all of your data.  Better yet, get a second hard drive and install 10.5 on the second hard drive and keep your options open to boot up on the old system.  Do a google search on Leopard and G4 problems.

"Dear Dave, I have been a long time user of ACT long before Sage took it over, and was a big fan.  I consider myself an adept. I use it to generate and track customer quotes, and correspondence (I am on version 9.0), It just used to be much more workable!  It's not that it is entirely unworkable but there are so many gothchas and gremlins that using ACT is often an exercise in frustration. The big thing for me is that the integration with Outlook is just awful,  For example, two of us in the office use ACT. Now when I send emails with attachments my ACT registers them, but my colleague cannot get her attachments recorded. We've set up our emails in exactly the same way and our ACTs in the same way. And for those of you considering buying take note, The support only lasts for 30 days so when I discovered this (and other issues) the 30 days had passed.  The support people (in India - I can tell from the accents and their rigid and scripted manner; nice people  but they have learnt well how to behave like City Hall!) they won't give help unless you pay for it.  The beef here is that since ACT has made many changes over time and issued different versions, inevitably functions have been moved or changed from a previous version.  Because ACT is somewhat complex you can't possibly discover in 30 days where all the changes have been made or how all the functions have changed.  So when you run into issues past 30 days you are confronted with the prospect of paying extra for support.  I can see the logic of your policy to generate revenue by selling support but that doesn't sit well with me. When I have set everything up according to your documentation and spent hours trying to find the relevant solution to my problem in the knowledgebase (which never seems to have my problem described) is it me, or is it due to latent deficiencies and bugs in your software?

"Well the old Humongous Entertainment games, the ones before Atari took them over, took 0 MB, lets say that out loud, ZERO MegaBytes of space on your hard drive.  This takes 600MB on your hard drive alone.  In addition it is a memory hog!!! 256MB of RAM just for itself, so if you run a bunch of things in the background, like most of us do, Anti-virus, firewalls, any update program, Etc... and you don't have gobs of memory to just give to the 3 year to 8 old who might use this program, forget it.

I am so, so very disappointed with Atari!!! Their first attempt was with Pajama Sam (#4) Life Rough When You Lose Your Stuff.  I bought this when it first came out thinking it was one of the great humongous entertainment new games, little did I know.  I tried to install it on my sons system and it totally froze up, then I actually read the product specs.  It looked like my son's computer had the minimum but the program didn't like his computer.

I had several computers at the time and tried it on another which rejected it also.  I then decided to put it on my main computer, this is what it worked with, which was the fastest and largest in the house at the time.  It did install and worked but took the majority of my memory at the time.  The voice was no longer the cute voice of Pajama Sam but a deeper more mature voice.  I could probably get over the new voice if I didn't have to use the best computer in the house to get it to work.  Truly I didn't play out the game nor did my son since it was on my computer. So I cannot say if it is fun or not but I can be almost certain that it is changed, not the same old Putt-Putt or Pajama Sam.

I am now re-ordering the old Putt-Putt, Freddi Fish, and Pajama Sam, that I have lost misplaced or given away, for my youngest.  They are wonderful!!  Some of the Putt-Putt's are so old that the quality is a bit rough, like Putt-Putt goes to the moon.

"Having bought and installed every version of Windows this installation and upgrade (from Windows Home XP) was the smoothest.  Microsoft's Beta testing appears to have been very successful.  By the way, I am just an average home computer user.

Vista first inventories the software and hardware and indexes whatever files are needed for the transfer.  Then it installs, which took about an hour in my case on a Celeron D CPU at 2.13 Gigahertz and a little over 1G of memory, with the standard Dell-Intel graphics chips (not exactly a high-end computer).

The look and feel and the interfaces and integration of Vista with other software is awesome.  The software has killer diagnostic tools that are a cut above the usual third party software algorithms--for example, Vista remembers what has been tried and tells you so if you try to repeat a recommended ""fix"".  I liked, and installed two ""gadgets"" in the left sidebar--a floating office--style clock and a calendar.

All the software on my machine functioned after the install and reboot, even software Vista identified as possibly not working--in my case, the Intellipoint mouse software.  It did work just fine.

The install did kill my broadband internet connection for a brief time; and after going 'round and 'round with the idiots at Adelphia/Comcast customer service--who stated that company modems did not work with Vista, and that they are not ready to offer help for their customer running Vista (do not believe them)--I fixed the connection after discovering (through a Vista diagnostic tool) that competing firewalls from Windows Security Center and Windows Live One Care were blocking inbound streams.

In fact, Vista has a very nice feature in its Windows Security Center (that helped me fix my broadband connectivity) which tells you when you have competing security features enabled.  In my case, it was two firewalls, one of which (Windows Lived One Care), was set to ""restricted"".  When I removed this firewall, and left the Security Center firewall enabled everything worked perfectly.

By the way, despite what I read elsewhere, my iTunes runs smoothly.  I also have lots of third party software (defraggers, spy removal software, password software, etc.) on my computer, and all of it, except the well-known buggy and unstable System Mechanic 7, operates without problems, and did so without having to download ""patches"".

I believe Microsoft did a great job on producing and testing Vista.  I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to move beyond XP.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,1

"WinZip was once an indispensable tool that I've used on every machine since Windows 3.1; however, its utility has declined and Corel has loaded it with so much extraneous junk that I'm too apprehensive to install it on a new PC.  My primary dissatisfaction is one of Corel's business integrity: a license-holding customer should NOT be provided with installation software that surrepticiously diverts the IE browser to Ask.com and installs a toolbar so simply so Corel can generate even more revenue IF the user accepts the ""recommended"" defaults.  I get the fact that software companies need monetize their wares and recoup their investment; however, for revenue consumers this is wrong.  The prosumers in you might wish to use WinZip's .iso file instead and make your modifications before installing.

In v18 and v19 there were big changes that increased the size of the graphics to accommodate touch screens, while eliminating the file tree that resembles Windows Explorer.  As a result, referencing multiple folders and paths within a Zip is much less efficient.  For example, while it's possible to include folders and the file paths in order to restore these files later, the Path feature must be activated before files are added to the Ziip (via a filter.)  This is neither efficient or intuitive.  When 19.5 was released I tested it on a virtual machine and found it included additional ""file management"" software that installs as startup utilities.  It appears that it can be turned off through the Options menu, but checking through Autoruns mine were still active.  It simply reinforced my impression that Corel's priority with WinZip is monetization, so check the privacy policy carefully should you choose to install.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0
"At first, I rated this 1 star because I was unable to install it. See my edited original review at the bottom.

This is the 3rd version of PaintShop I have used. There's a reason I keep buying it. While I do have Photoshop on a different system and, while it does offer more tools, it does so at a hefty price. PaintShop is inexpensive and easy to use but still powerful enough to get the job done.

I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 due to the installation issues and Corel's poor technical support. Here are some tips for anyone who faces similar problems. If you receive the ""Unable to validate the serial number"" error and know that your Internet connection is working, then the seller probably failed to activate the serial number. Either contact the seller or return the software and buy it from a more reputable seller. If you get the ""Fatal error during installation"" message, it may be because you have previously installed PaintShop. Simply uninstalling the older version probably won't be sufficient to resolve the issue, since traces are left behind in the registry. To resolve this, I edited my registry and removed all mentions of PaintShop. CAUTION: Editing your registry can cause Windows to stop operating properly, so be sure to create a backup before you begin making changes. After completing the edits and closing regedit, I used Glary Utilities Free 1-Click Maintenance section and checked all the boxes. I don't know if that was necessary, though. While some don't like registry cleaners, I'm a computer tech and have used this one probably over 100 times with nothing but satisfactory results. Nevertheless, if you're worried about it, skip it. I restarted my computer and attempted the installation again and had no problems with either disc.

ORIGINAL 1-STAR REVIEW (edited)

If the problem is resolved, I will update this review accordingly.

I have used 2 previous versions of PaintShop and was pleased with them, so I purchased this one, thinking all would be well. However, I am unable to install the software. I receive a cryptic message stating ""Unable to validate the serial number. An Internet connection is required to complete the installation."" I do have an Internet connection and even temporarily disabled my firewall. Still, the installation will not proceed. I contacted Corel over a week ago and have received only 3 messages: the first acknowledged the creation of the ticket, the second and third both stated that they are awaiting further information (but they never asked for more information). I'm running Windows 8.1.

I think the problem with the first copy was that the seller (sold by a third party, shipped by Amazon) failed to activate the serial number. So, I returned it and reordered one that was both sold by and shipped by Amazon. The second one did not display the error mentioned above. Instead, it gave me an even-more-cryptic message, ""Fatal error during installation."" So far, I'm 0-2 with this software.

"If you've used tax software in the past you know what you're getting in this package. As stated in the product information the federal e-files are included even though it's not in the software title. The download from Amazon was simple and the installation was smooth. (The key code needed to install the program is easy to obtain. It's located under ""Your Account"" -> Digital Content ""Your Games and Software Library."") I was able to easily upload last year's return (as I used&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/H-R-Block-At-Home-2010-Deluxe-Federal-State-eFile/dp/B0047UEXP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">H&R Block At Home 2010 Deluxe Federal + State + eFile</a>) and start inputing my information. There is still some ambiguity in some of the interview questions but for the most part the interview is clear.
Be aware that they try to upsell the ""Premium"" package in this software very early. It's annoying and easily clicked away from but I can see them snagging an extra $20 fairly swiftly if someone wasn't used to using software like this. I am willing to look over this for the cheaper price tag and that I have had no troubles using it to e-file both my Federal and State taxes in recent years.
I commend H&R Block (and Intuit for that matter) for being much more visible on their pricing this year. The comparison chart clearly states that the state e-file is an additional $19.95. Compared to TurboTax pricing at $57 (11/28/11) + the state e-file $19.95, this is the clear price winner.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,1

"I've been using Acronis TrueImage, but their latest version, 9, has been a major disappointment. I've stayed with the previous working version until they either fixed all the bugs with current version or another company came up with a better product. I read a positive review in Smart Computing magazine about this product, so I gave it a try. Let me say I'll stay with TrueImage 8 until another product comes along.

First of all, my startup time with Backup MyPc was noticeably longer. Secondly my antivirus didn't load up. I had to manually start the antivirus. On the next reboot my firewall didn't load up. I had none of these problems with TrueImage 8. Finally I figured I'd get to the guts of the matter and see how the program worked with reinstalling individual files from a backup. After a few minutes I gave up waiting for the program to search for files. Canceled it and uninstalled.

This is the third product I've tried and experience has taught me if bugs start off initially, then don't bother and move along. As it stands my older version of my backup program works flawlessly, and there are still other programs I've yet to examine. Oh, one more thing.

But theirs just to many negative aspects about it that will make you want to pull your hair out, especially if your using a regular desktop computer with mouse and keyboard.

"I have been using Turbo Tax for years.  I have found it easy to use.  I don't usually skip sections.  Just easier for me to go through each section.  No problem importing my data from the prior year.  A long while back I switched to another product because of calculations errors Turbo Tax made and while it guarantees the calculations it was such a hassle to prove to them it wasn't worth it so I switched.  I came back a few years later and there was no issue importing my data from a competing product.

I like the guided menus.  And this year's product seems to be just as easy to use and helpful.  This Premier product does offer features that use.  It may be more than others may need like stocks and bonds, for instance.

While it comes with one state download, it does not include a state e-file.  That gets to be expensive.  As is buying another state download which I need to do.  I have had issues with e-filing my resident state because Intuit did not include a copy of the other state return which is a requirement.  So I don't e-file and mail it in.  They said they would fix that, but I haven't seen anything that says they did.

All in all I like this product and it makes my life much easier.  I remember the days of taking pen to the 1040 and other forms and using a calculator... talk about stress.  I recommend this particular edition if you need the financial guidance for your investments.  Otherwise try a less expensive version.  You should find it very easy and intuitive.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,1

"I had very high hopes for this release, but there were some features I just couldn't stand, and other issues that weren't fixed from Quicken 2013:
*Inline reminders were difficult to clean up
*The new ""polished"" .NET UI is much slower than the old MFC-based widgets that were replaced (Quicken 2011, how I miss you!)
*Budgeting really hasn't been totally fixed. There were lots of glitches and managing biweekly paychecks is a royal pain if you choose to budget based on gross, rather than net income.
*Quicken ID / Intuit ID is a total mess. I just want to download my transactions in peace without another middleman.
*Dashboards with widgets make everything else really slow. I love using them, but each time I enter a transaction, the dashboards are updated behind the scenes. Fix this please.

"I didn't like the ribbon interface when it was first introduced.  I kept Office XP until I needed more vibrant Power Point presentations.  The ribbon interface was massaged in Office 2010 and it works well, especially compared to the prior version.  Office is the gold standards of productivity applications.  There is a little bit of a learning curve with this new version, but me and my wife like it (she also has been a long term Office user).  On the aesthetic side it looks good, and you can download many themes for documents and Power Point presentations.  Excel works well, with good graphing capabilities, but not as intuitive.  OneNote is included and I haven't really gotten into it.  Its supposed to be like a digital notepad, but for whatever reason I haven't warmed to it.

All in all it is a great program (once you get used to it, I especially like the Power Point animation, and the ability to save to PDF.  I would recommend this program to anyone that needs a good solid set of productivity tools that is also a standard in the business world (good to have transferable skills to the workplace). PDF integration is a good feature to have.  On the other hand, nothing really is revolutionary with this version of Office.  If it weren't for needing to have a better Power Point than the XP version, I would say this program isn't a must.  Why do I say that?  If you have Office before ribbon, and have all your icon bars customized and are able to do everything, you can probably be faster at getting things done than with 2010.  On the other hand must people don't use half the functions office was able to do, and the ribbon interface makes it easier for many people use.

Having the program in Amazon is really great.  No need to worry where you put the installation disk if you need to install on a new machine years from now.  It was a easy to download and install.

"I am a die hard Mac fan but the iMovie product is about 2 years old now and since Apple has been moving away from iDVD its not good to be so locked into a program that if it gets dropped like (iWeb, iDVD) I don't want to be left out in the cold.

I sampled Elements 11, Cyberlinks newest, Muvee, Sony's offerings but found and settled on Magix.

First off, It takes advantage of the CHEAPER hardware found in PC's. I took a two year old HP with an AMD Quad processor that i got really cheap, through in a 128 GB Crucial SSD ($100 Amazon Prime) through in a 1 TB 7200 RPM SATA drive for Data and loaded the Magix program. I haven't done any other upgrades yet because the program runs great just on that. BUT I can always upgrade the Graphics card - which they recommend, add more RAM, etc.
So bottom line: Cheaper hardware, lots of options.

Then I installed the program, watched a few getting started videos and stated playing around.

The interface and workflow is Great. It does take some playing around, I'm still figuring out how to add titles and center them like in iMovie it has those lines that tell you when you're in the middle of the screen, there's something like that but you have to play around with it.

But the editing, trimming, quality of output and the SLOW MOTION kills iMovie's blocky choppy slow motion. I'm using sony 1080 60p and it can handle it just fine. the quality of the rendering is great and of all the other programs it  is the easiest program to adapt to if you've been using iMovie for any length of time.

At at the current price? I paid $30 while it was on sale. If you don't get it you're really missing out. Its a great program trust me, I don't ever write recommendations but I did for this program

One of the deciding factors for me in purchasing this product was the advertised ""mobile device"" ability which was clearly advertised on the packaging and in the product description as included in the 2013 edition.  Once received and installed I could find nothing on this very key and relevant feature.  Spent an hour on the website with no success. I finally had to call ACT, only to be told that to USE this feature(included), I needed to PAY an additional $70 per year. I told them this was false advertising - no response. If that wasn't bad enough, that money only gets you a one-way synch (from ACT to device). Maybe someone should tell them that many companies offer this feature free of charge: Dropbox, Evernote, etc.  The impression of this company SAGE ACT, is one of a DECEPTIVE COMPANY OUT FOR A MONEY GRAB. There were very few ""New"" features in the 2013 ""Anniversary Edition"" over previous versions.

I purchased the 2014 version to do my mother's taxes but now I find out that the $25 refund or free upgrade for the 2014 version only applies to customers who bought the 2013 version as well.

There were a number of web and Windows-related updates and installs required - a plug-in, the Garmin Installer, an upgrade to the Microsoft.

Just pay attention to the emails and other instructions provided after the purchase - this is not like a typical buy and forget Amazon order.

The one issue that I did encounter was that there wasn't enough space on my Nuvi 650 to load the entire North America update.  You're ostensibly supposed to be able to augment your Nuvi's memory with an SD card, so I inserted a 1GB SD card but was informed that there was still insufficient space.  I found no guidance on how to use the SD card or how large it should be, so I selected just the ""US and Canada"" maps, and the Garmin updated okay.

"I don't usually write reviews. Fact of the matter is, with the exception of Photoshop, which I am a confirmed devotee of, I don't get too excited about software. I have to admit though that this particular version of DNS has really knocked my socks off!

Being semi-disabled, typing is a real problem for me. I have actually had trouble getting a job because most companies will not let me use voice typing software even though I type about twice as fast with it as I do on my own.

Frankly, it's been a pain in the tush! Getting a voice typing program that actually works consistently and has good recognition results has not been an easy thing. This is the first version of this program that I have tried that really works and I have been using the program on and off since version 5!

Version 8 has been actually been accurate enough that I can use it for everything from e-mail to doing my job. From what I can tell it gets about 99% of what I am saying, and that is pretty decent compared to the same application say five years ago! It's not perfect, but it does allow me to do my job,and go about my daily activities computer-wise, without too much pain being involved.

(shrug)

What can I say?

I just can't do anything on my computer without it these days!

It works almost flawlessly in every single program I have tried it in, and that includes my non-standard e-mail program, online in chat boxes, and even in difficult areas like this.

I can't wait to see what they will come up with in the next version. With the exception of the fact that this version never seems to capitalize the first word of a sentence, which drives me crazy, this is about as good as I ever thought voice-recognition could get! I am learning to get around the few small quirks, and I must admit, otherwise, this program has really been a godsend for me.

I have read reviews of professional voice type programs that cost five times as much and they don't seem to indicate any more satisfaction in terms of results than I am getting with DNS8. Yeah, it was a bear doing all the training, but I found that the little bit of effort had a considerable effect on my ability to accurately voice type.

I am pretty pleased thus far!

Nice job ScanSoft! You folks are doing a fine job, and I am very happy to say so. You have really made it a lot easier for me to deal with having an annoying disability, and I really do appreciate that! Every little bit helps, and I find that DNS8 takes a huge load off my damaged body in terms of wear and tear and stress.

I am much obliged, and please DO keep up the good work!

Yes, every word of this review was definitely typed in DNS8. It took me all of 10 minutes, and I hardly had to correct a thing besides! If, ya'll think I am working for the company, you couldn't be more wrong here! Nope, not a corporate stooge, singing the praises of a company product just to get your attention, I am a real-life user, who just happens to find this particular program about as useful as it gets!

If you are looking for good voice-recognition, look no further! This is about as good as it gets unless you are willing to spend a whole heck of a lot more money, and waste about 10 times the time trying to get it to work!

Believe me when I tell you I have tried them all, and this is the only voice type program that even comes close to allowing me to get the job done!

Yeah, I guess this is a glowing review, but darn it, ScanSoft has earned it with this one! I must have waited at least a decade to be able to do this with any amount of real accuracy. To finally be able to write, to do my job, every day, effectively and with minimal effort, using a headset? To be able to type again without killing my neck and back?

Well, it's pretty darned cool...

"I totally disagree to tanis1111's review of this excellent title.
Keeping in mind that I played literally hundreds of games so far, (some good, some bad), I've become quite spoilt with games; so far, out of 50 games I play, I usually only like one or two to the extent of me actually playing on and on to complete them. Usually, I get fed up by the annoying gameplay, or the repetitiveness of the game in general.
Having played several other LEGO games as well, I found that LEGO Island Xtreme Stunts successfully combines a lot of different genres, to bring the LEGO world to life. I found this title quite refreshing; not only can the character walk and swim around this unique island; he can also use his skateboard, or drive/fly/sail using vehicles found on the island. Additionally, the stunts really do combine a lot of genres: race and trash the opponent on land, sea or even in the air! Solve interesting logic puzzles or just use your skateboard to go about the island, performing neat tricks as you go.
Whereas I found other PC game titles like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, The Need for Speed and Crazy Taxi a bit boring and repetitive, LEGO Island Xtreme Stunts manages to combine all these games, and successfully place it in a world based on the LEGO universe, balancing the game so it never becomes boring.
I caught myself playing this game for hours. IMO, the bottom line for this game is the fact that it's a great deal, figuring the graphics are OK, the sound rocks ('radio'-music along the lines of GTA3 is present), and the gameplay never gets old. I'd recommend this game to anyone, seeing this package offers a great mixture of a lot of games, yet being very well priced.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,0

"My netbook has many hours of home video files stored on it that I wanted to share with family.  Using Nero 2014 Platinum and a USB DVD writer, I have had success burning these movies.  Read on to find out what this software can really do!

Installation
I installed Nero 2014 Platinum on my Acer Aspire V5-122P-0637 netbook.  The AMD quad core processor and 6Gb of memory seemed more than enough to try out video editing on my favorite portable computer.  The installer detected that I needed Microsoft XML 4.0 SP3 and a reboot validator so I had to restart my system to complete the process on my Microsoft Windows 8.1 64bit machine.  Upon reboot, I entered my serial number and began the file install.  Approximately 15 minutes later Nero was installed.  The content pack took another 10 minutes to load.

Use
First and foremost, before Nero 2014 Platinum was installed on my Acer Aspire several of my movies could not be played because their file extensions were not recognized.  After installation, the MKV video files could be played.

Next, I burned a digital copy of a movie I purchased to DVD+R Double Layer disc using Nero Video.  The process took 2 hours 35 minutes to complete, mostly because of the transcoding process.  The transcoding used all four cores of my AMD A6-1450 cpu.

Extras
The Nero 2014 Platinum installation DVD also features content packs.  You will find video effects, themes and menu templates in this collection of content.

In conclusion, Nero 2014 Platinum does a fine job of editing and burning movies.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,0

"Vista was pure eye-candy junk when it came out in January 2007 without a doubt.  But, like it's big brothers 2K-Pro and XP, those two were also serious heat producing hardware killers when they came out in late 1999 and late 2001.  Neither one was up to snuff until their first service packs came out either.  Vista seems to be following the same protocol - no real software compatibilities until a year after it's release and standard hardware isn't tough enough until a year later as well.

Also know that XP is really nothing more than a toy filled and dolled up 2000 Professional, whereas 2000 Professional was a hybrid of Win98 and NT4. In short, XP's built off of twelve year old technology (NT4/2000), so it's no surprise that the bugs have been mostly worked out.

I think the disgust towards Vista is mainly due to things being located in different areas compared to NT4/2000/XP which were all virtually the same as far as file locations were concerned.  Just give Vista a spin and learn it.  Since it's release of SP1, it's now become stable enough to go digging around without causing some oddball crash.

Vista is hardly ME's little brother, unless you're trying to run Vista on a Pentium II 400 or trying to run both DVD Maker and installing Photoshop at the same time.

2014 introduced some really aggravating display bugs -- specifically losing cursor location when navigating out of and back into a register. That seems to be fixed in 2016 -- have to wait and see if all scenarios where it occurred in 2014 have been addressed,
2014 could not display full screen on a 1920x1080 external monitor and was a garbled mess on my new 12"" HD notebook (wildly inconsistent font sizes - huge in register extremely small in lists), doubled menu items) -- 2016 displays correctly on the new notebook and, with some inconsistency, is able to display full screen on the 1920x1080 external monitor.
So... ~$70 for fixes that should never have been broken and getting back to the functionality that I had 5 years ago. At least its working again.
Also, as noted in the headline, even though the Amazon.com product page says the digital download is not returnable, Amazon.com support (via chat) assured me that Quicken would issue a refund by check under their 100% satisfaction guarantee, though at this point it looks like that may not be necessary.
*** Updated after first attempt to reconcile my checking account -- reconcile could not find any cleared transacrtions; manually set them all to uncleared, reconcile still could not find them.
Display on external monitor still very flaky -- sometimes get a blank page, resize or maximaze, and it renders, change file, get blank page again, restore previous window size, maybe it renders, maybe not.
I will be requesting a refund from intuit. I will switch to something else -- anything else -- for my 2017 records.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0
"Corel Painter is a MUST, if you are serious about digital art, as it's unparalleled in the way it mimics traditional media. I illustrate children's books and Painter is an important part of my arsenal of digital tools. I wouldn't want to be without it.

 It seems like many new to digital art wonder whether they should purchase Photoshop or Painter or something else. Painter is a necessary tool if you want to create art more like the ""old-fashioned"" way (like you would in a real life art studio with real paints, etc.) and are not intimidated by having to learn a very robust, and deep program. Painter is the program where digital tools behave more like their counterparts in the real world. Watercolors ""dry"" on your digital canvas, you can mix oil paints just like you would real oil paints in an art studio, and the digital chalks have that ""chalky"" texture. Even the digital markers behave like real ones - going on somewhat transparently with overlapping strokes that become more opaque as you continue coloring. Painter has tons of tools with endless variations and the ability to customize to your heart's content. You get to play with acrylics, airbrushes, charcoal & conte, chalk, crayons, gels, gouache, liquid inks, pastels, sumi-e, watercolors, and lots more. There are even particle brushes that create amazing effects like smoke & dynamic fur, as well as pens that paint patterns of flowers, or chain, or even neon. There are also tools that mimic famous painter's styles like Van Gogh, Seurat, impressionist style, and so on. You could sit and ""play"" all day and not even go over ever possibility of every tool! You can even change all of the settings for each tool, to make it something really unique, and save your settings to use again and again. There are over 25 categories of brushes, each with a multitude of variants. I looked up the official number of brushes, and there are 806 (compare that to the 126 brushes in Painter Essentials)!! Look at the screenshot I uploaded of some of the paint marks I made with various brushes. I went through the categories and painted on the canvas with different ones, so you can see just a tiny bit of the options you'd have with Painter. It's like having an art store on your computer. You can even pick out different types of paper / canvas (smooth, textured, colored, whatever).

You don't have to be a traditional artist to use Painter, though. Painter also has the capability to take a photograph and turn it into a painting using the multitude of brush options via cloning options. It also has tracing paper! Quick cloning is a time-saving tool I sometimes use to make some of the backgrounds for my illustrations. The computer does a lot of the work to turn a picture into a painting (in seconds or minutes) with all sorts of options to make things unique, but you can fine-tune it and add your own personal touches, so that it's not totally cheating, lol. The 2nd screenshot I uploaded (of a flower) is something I made using the tracing paper and the cloning tools. It took me about 4 minutes to create. With Painter you can create art that is nearly impossible to create in the ""real world"". And it has an undo button. ;-)

There are also Photoshop style tools, layer capabilities (like many layers of glass that overlap that you can draw/paint on), selection tools, vector pen tools, a paint bucket (to dump color or patterns like plaids and so on onto your canvas or into a selection), color correction, and other digital tools you can find in just about any digital photo / art program. You really don't want to use Painter for photo editing though. That's more of a job for Photoshop. Painter is forwell painting, lol, (and drawing, sketching, airbrushing, etc.). You can paint and draw in Photoshop, but that's not its original design purpose. I use both (along with Manga Studio / Clip Studio Paint, Krita, Illustrator, and Sketchbook Pro). They are all important tools that excel in different things.  Another reviewer likened the Painter and Photoshop to a hammer vs. a screwdriver, and he's spot on. I have to have Photoshop to accomplish specific tasks Painter just can't do (a lot of image manipulation and that type of thing). I have to have Painter to mimic the real life painting techniques that Photoshop just can't do. Bottom line is if you want to paint, get Painter. If you want to do digital art that is more about manipulating images, get Photoshop (if you can stomach the nasty subscription model they moved to - I personally am sticking with Photoshop CS6, until I can find an alternative).

Please note that (in my opinion / experience) Painter is NOT the best for inking (think comic book style drawing). I've found that Manga Studio (which is also known as Clip Studio Paint) is better for that, in that the lines are nice and better stabilized (there is a slider that will make it so it will auto correct tiny jitters as you draw). It is also not the best if you just want to sketch. Getting Painter to sketch is overkill and there are other programs that are better for drawing. I think Painter is truly BEST suited for PAINTING (watercolors, oils, acrylics, etc.).

If you are NEW to digital art, I recommend getting your feet wet, first, in something like Sketchbook Pro (or Painter Essentials) that is much more inexpensive and easier to use. Sketchbook Pro is easy enough for a child to use. You can literally sit down, open it up and start sketching and drawing in no time (you can take a look at my review here on Amazon, under my profile). The basic tools are intuitive from the outset and It's very freeing not to have to learn all sorts of complicated controls & commands, etc. , especially for a beginner. You can try it to see if you like digital art, and then, if you do, you might be interested in pursuing something like Painter to take a step in a more professional direction.  Painter is a quite a bit more of a challenge with endless options that can be daunting to a new user, but Corel offers lots of free video tutorials to help you get started. Also, if you would like to learn how to use it quickly, I recommend getting a month's subscription to Lynda.com. They have a great beginning video course on how to use Painter that goes over the various tools and how to get the most from them. I've been using Painter for about 15 years, and even I learned something from the Lynda.com video for the 2015 version.

Please note, if you are interested in purchasing Painter, you really need a digital tablet to draw directly on such as a Wacom Intuos, or Cintiq. This is not a program to use with a mouse (imagine writing your name on paper with a tool shaped like a mouse!). You need a digital pen in hand. I have used it with both of the above. Painter works very well with Wacom tablets and responds to the tilt, speed, pressure, etc. of the Wacom pens. There are less expensive tablet options (Yiynova, Huion, etc.) but they are not (in my opinion) as good as Wacom. If you have something like a Surface Pro, you can already draw directly on the screen. Anyway, the point is, you need something to draw with other than a mouse. ;-)

If you already have Painter and are wondering if an upgrade is worth it, for me it was. The brushes are MUCH faster (no more lag time), the brushes track better, and the new particle brushes are amazing (and fun to play with, lol). I recommend trying the 30 day free trial to see if the upgrades are worth it, which is what I did. The increase in speed alone was so worth it for me (I'm on a bit of an older computer so lots of my art programs lag if I have a really big brush, etc.).

Also, don't be afraid to get Painter as a digital download if you are like me and want the instant gratification of receiving your purchase right then and there, lol. I've purchased software downloads from Amazon numerous times, with no hitches.

If, after reading this review, you have any questions, please ask via the comment button below. I'll be happy to try and help out!

Bottom line: Painter is a worthwhile program that is the best at mimicking real life media, but especially paint. If you want to take your digital art to the next level, or want something that will behave more like the ""real"" stuff, and less like digital tools, this is what you are looking for. Just keep in mind that there is a LOT to learn, and if you are a beginner you might be best served by a less expensive program, to start with. Painter is an amazing tool that helps me create my illustrations, and I highly recommend it, with that particular reservation in mind. '",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,1

"Don't buy this- the back-up is terrible.

 I have owned this product for almost a year and can't wait for the year to expire. I bought it mainly for the back- up feature which is the problem. It's terrible. Although managing the back-ups or setting up is easy the problem is Norton is always giving me the error message ""not enough space need to buy more"". I get this message despite the fact I have twice as much back-up space than needed. What a great way for Norton to make money on unneeded support or space. A waste of money for me and frustrating.

Support is useless although I have tried many times. From India, of course so it's scripted. I question if they were competent.

I have 89 gigs back-up with two pc's and am only backing up less than 40 gigs. Norton says I have 13 gigs of available space. Then why am I getting Norton error messages stating the cure is to purchase more back-up space if I have less than 40 gigs to back-up, purchased 89 gigs and have 13 gigs available?  None of this adds up.

It appears the problem is every time it backup updates up it adds the total amount of backup data to the required amount. So if you have 50 gigs and want to update the back-up it adds 50gigs to the amount of space needed so the  amount of space needed grows exponentially?!

"Having used this product for over half a year, I feel I should warn fellow computer users of a recurrent problem (also alluded to by another reviewer).  The Real-time Scanner for the antivirus product often turns itself off.  After a looong wait on the phone, the support folks in India politely walked me through turning it back on.  The procedure is to turn Real-Time Scanning off, reboot the computer, turn Real-time Scanning back on, and reboot again.

The support tech I had the first time assured me this should only have to be fixed once, and the product worked fine for a few months.  Now the Real-time Scanner turns itself off every time the product checks for updates.  So if I want to keep scanning for viruses, I have to regularly go through the multi-reboot cycle.

As with my problems with the Norton Suite a while back, I am mystified as to why none of the downloaded patches fix the manufacturer's own coding errors.

In other respects, the Computer Associates suite has performed similarly to the competent ZoneAlarm suite of which it is a derivative; the scanning quality is not the greatest, though, as it does miss items the free Lavasoft Ad-Aware and Spybot Search and Destroy non-real-time scanners regularly weed from my system.  Of the products I have used, the Norton suite worked fine in earlier revisions, but the last version I had was a disaster.  So I switched to ZoneAlarm, which I kept for the life of the first year's subscription.  Though it functioned very well, I did not continue with ZoneAlarm due to rising costs.

"TIP: Always download the trial version of anti-virus products and test them. I found a HUGE difference between Kaspersky Pure and Kaspersky Pure 2. Here is my experience:

I had Kaspersky Pure. I used it without problem. I tested my upload speed with Kaspersky Pure installed using SpeedTest dot Net. My upload speed was 13mbps upload speed and 60 mbps download speed.

I installed Kaspersky internet security 2012 and Kaspersky Pure 2.0 (separately of course, not simultaneously). I tested my upload speed at 3mbps with both products and download speed was 60 mbps with both products. That is a difference of 10 mbps upload speed! It appears that both Kaspersky Pure 2.0 and Kaspersky Internet Security 2012 do some kind of deep packet inspection that severely cripples your upload speed.

I re-installed Kaspersky Pure and my upload speed resumed to 13mpbs. I will simply renew the license of this product until Kaspersky gets their act together. If the problem is not fixed, I will have to switch to another anti virus.

Do the test and see for yourself how it affects your upload speed before buying this product.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,1
"The tax software handles everything pretty smoothly except for the sale of a Master Limited Partnership (MLP) that is sold through and reported by a broker on a 1099-B form.  This  part of the software is horrendous.  The MLP sale problems are:
1.  The K-1 entries create another sale which is already reported by the broker on a 1099-B thus creating a double entry for the
  one sale.
2.  Turbo tax provides a work around which is much too complicated for the average user.

Other MLP K-1 issues:
1.  Turbo Tax cannot download all of the information on the K-1 that is provided by the MLP.
2.  More specific and clearer information is needed in order to correctly enter some of the K-1 data that is manually entered.
3.  Good luck on being able to talk to someone on the phone that can address Turbo Tax issues.

I would gladly pay more money for a software program that could handle MLP sales efficiently.  Apparently Turbo Tax is unwilling to solve this issue.  It has been a problem for years.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0
"I was one of the fortunate people who did not have problems with installation of the software. As noted by the other reviewers who were able to get software to work, this speech recognition far exceeds that of previous voice-recognition programs for the Mac.  The biggest drawback to this program is that it does not have the ability to learn words that are not in its dictionary. This is problematic for professionals such as physicians and lawyers who use technical language that is not in the software dictionary. The other posts suggest that this functionality will come with future releases. At the present time, the absence of this function is a significant limitation for anyone who requires technical terms for their writing. That said, it is extremely accurate for non-technical dictating. In addition, the software is quirky.  My current problem is that it occasionally deletes, copies, and pastes words or sentences, and I have no idea where these came from or why the program is doing this. The program is a useful piece of software but does not totally replace the need for a keyboard. Presumably the program will work better in the future as updates are released. The purpose of this review is to indicate that the software does work for me, which apparently has not been the case for many purchasers. For this reason, it gets two stars. However the software clearly has limitations, the most significant of which is the inability to learn new words. In addition, it is quirky. I can recommend it with these caveats.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0

"As an attorney, I was looking to see how easy it was to set up and complete a will with this program. It was super easy to set up several important documents (will, health directives and such).  The program is easy to install (on windows 7), easy to use and intuitive.

I did have some issues with this. First, the documents export to PDF and it doesn't give you the Option to edit the document itself in the program. You have tomexport to RTF and edit in word. There is no way to add other provision in the program, only of you export to word. Once exported, there are several unnecessary pages and areas I could have done without. This is the biggest fault of this program. Second, the power of attorney for Connecticut was a bit too involved. There is a state 2 page form and that's what I prefer using.

I bought several of the earlier versions of this when it was first launched years ago, and thought it was both interesting and pretty effective. Sure, you don't need technology to meditate, BUT, it does a good job of focusing you so the ""real world"" is easier to ignore, and best of all, the biofeedback component gives you a sense that when you are trying to meditate, you're actually getting somewhere, at least in a physiological sense. So it's excellent for newbies. The graphics and music are a little New Age (not necessarily a bad thing), but they handled it pretty well. It's really too bad because it's effective.

"I tried the developer preview out and was not a big fan. So I was very biased against this version. Though I will have to install it eventually across 60+ computers I decided to test it out again on my secondary computer (expecting the worst).

My original take was that I disliked the tiles, missed my favorite Win 7 features (the start menu search bar), and missed the glass effect, also the dev version was rather slower than Win 7.

I admit I really like Windows 8!

 - The tiles have grown on me, they look good and are easy to understand
 - The search bar is still there, you just have to start typing and you get the same results. Even less clicking than before!
 - I like the new look, it is very customizable and without the drag the glass effect was causing
 - The beta was slow, the consumer version is not. I find it faster than Win7. Though time well tell.
 - The Apps are very easy to install and use
 - Easy to manage on an enterprise level

I work with a lot of OSes and usually prefer Windows but I have a healthy respect for OSX and iOS, with that said Microsoft really put a foot forward and breathed new life into their product. I think design wise they really nailed it and system wise they also hit it out of the park.

My main problem is that with two little kids, there's a lot of background noise in the house which easily confuses them. So my writing is limited while they are up.but when there are either taking a nap or asleep for the night it goes pretty fast -- but still slower than typing, just because I find it easier to talk in small phrases and check it for errors as I go then try and reread it from the beginning and catch all the goofy recognition errors.

Bottom line: if you have carpal tunnel syndrome or some other condition that makes it difficult to type, don't hesitate to buy this product. Plus, version 10 seems to work fine with Vista on my low to mid end laptop -- not hogging that much resources. If you have no problem typing, or work with a lot of background noise, don't even bother.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,0

"I've been a fan of TurboTax for years.  Each year I complete tax returns jointly with my wife, my Mother, and teenagers.  It retrieves our personal information from the previous years forms so you do not waste time retyping/mis-typing info that likely did not change.  It also has a view to allow me to compare side-by-side last years amounts to this years amounts in each category (income, deductions, etc). That feature allows me to make sure I'm capturing everything.  I used a tax preparer years ago and determined we were coming up with the same result, so instead of paying him $400, I bought TurboTax for a fraction of the price.

As the years roll by I find my tax return becoming more complex (rental property, selling stocks & mutual funds, small business income, stock options, etc).  TurboTax has the right product for me to fit my specific situation in a given year.

The tool will walk you through a 'guided tour' or let you explore the various sections on your own - I usually go thru the tour and then later specifically visit the various income & deductions sections as I make adjustments.  The included 'It's Deductable' software is amazing.  We keep a list of all of the items that we donate to charities over the year, and just plug them in to this software and it calculates the reasonable value of the item donated.

Why can't you give me a copy of the XP recovery disk?

I have a copy of XP Pro, but why should I have to track down drivers,
spend my time dicking around, because you sold me an inferior product.
In fact, this is the last product you will sell me. I have been reading
and talking to many people that are pulling their hair out about Vista.
I don't think that my problem is isolated or unique. The last Windows
update, which I can't stop, or it's BSOD for me, really made a mess of
things. Every page with a certificate is denied, even HP's page.

If I spend $159 upgrading to Vista Ultimate will you downgrade me?

I am not going to play email tag, while you patronize me, and convince
me that I caused this mess. But even if Vista worked,I don't want this
bloated piece or resource grabbing junk, not to mention all the HP
bloatware, that I can't get rid of.

Are you going to take responsibility for this mess, and send me an XP
recovery disk, or not?

If not, reply, so I can take you out of my favorites.

Hello Pat,

Thank you for writing back.

I understand that you would like to have shipped a copy of Windows XP as you are not satified with the Vista Operating System.

I regret to inform you that, HP does not support downgrading of the Operating System and will not provide any downgradable Discs to install the XP Operating System on your Notebook. As you wish to downgrade the Operating System to XP, the only option is to go for a retail version of the XP Operating System. Regarding the drivers for XP, I will provide the list of drivers that will work on your Notebook with the XP Operating System. If you would like to continue using vista and to avoid the issues that you are currently experiencing, I request you to perform F11 Recovery to recover the Notebook to factory settings. It is recommended to take the backup of the data before performing F11 Recovery as this will erase all the user information. Please follow the steps given below to perform F11 Recovery:",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0

"I tried Qmac 2015 as a substitute for QWin 2012 for 2 reasons.  I'm primarily a Mac user and only use Windows via VMWare for QWin 2012, so fully ditching Windows would eliminate one OS to maintain.  Also, QWin 2012's ability to download transactions stops on 4/30/2015 and QWin 2015 will not work on XP, so a newer Windows OS would be needed.  Continued maintenance of another OS and additional cost were reasons to see if QMac 2015 would do the job for me.

It is different from the Windows versions, but I was able to get by them to make it do what I needed (bank and investment account monitoring and balancing).  However, I got stuck in the squeeze of the limited connection methods employed by QMac 2015 and American Funds inability or choice not to work with them.  That broke the deal for me.

I properly uninstalled all Norton and tried to install the McAfee.  It seemed like an okay full install and upon reboot I had a crashed computer.  I had to recover Win98.  I again contacted their tech support via chat (the 2nd of 7 times).  With their advice I was finding files/folders to delete, checking Windows Registry again, running ScanDisk and Defrag for a hopefully ""clean install"".  It didn't work.  On my own decision, I attempted installing one by one the Virus, Firewall, Privacy and Spamkiller.  I'd get the 3 to work but not the Privacy, which kept freezing on install.  Once that happened the computer was wrecked again.  Sometimes during Privacy install I'd get a ""missing Privacy components, must re-install"" kind of message.

At some points all other components of the Suite displayed as

working.  I online updated the AntiVirus, ran it and no virus were found.  So I would try to install Privacy separate...and every time my computer would restart frozen on a plain blue-cloud desktop screen with nothing I could do.  About 8 tech support online chat sessions and they told me it's a Windows problem.  I disagreed and asked for a refund - because I'd rebuild windows and my computer and all other programs ran fine. Then the Mcafee install would destroy Win98, when I'd recover and or rebuild Win98 that would uninstall parts of McAfee...and back and forth, back and forth....so I gave up.  I've mailed in the refund form which hopefully I will receive promptly.

I've installed all types of software, installed or changed hardware components, etc. and never had an experience like this.  It was 72 hours of hell.  My wild guess - the McAfee is permeating and altering too many aspects of Windows and other programs OR a terribly defective install CD-ROM.

I don't hear great things about Norton and I may never buy a McAfee program again because of the install nightmare I just had.  Maybe Denfender-Pro or Computer Associates EZ-Armor?  I do have to give points to McAfee for being able to chat online with with tech support for free (support also gave me a toll-free customer service number).  You can't say that about many software companies.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0

"It feels like Quicken/Intuit don't care much about their customers.  If they did, they would have:

a) Fixed all of the problems with Quicken 2007 for Mac
b) Not waited 3.5 years to come out with a new product for Mac users
c) Not handed us this seriously hobbled product.
- No Bill Pay (WHAT!!!???)
- No export to TurboTax
- No tracking of investment buy/sells
- No ability to print checks

You're left to ask, why would I use this product? What value (at all) does it provide? I'm really scratching my head here...

Quickens own website recommends using Quicken 2007 over this version!!??  In Intuit's own words:

-----

1. Can I track my investments?
Yes, Quicken Essentials for Mac allows you to track the overall value of your investment accounts and the value of your specific holdings. It will not, however, track investment buys and sells, nor will it provide some advanced investment performance reports. If you need more more advanced investment features, try QUICKEN MAC 2007.

2. Can I export my data to TurboTax?
Quicken Essentials for Mac does not support that capability. If you'd like that functionality, we recommend trying QUICKEN MAC 2007.

3. Can I pay my bills within Quicken?
While you cannot pay bills within the product itself (""direct bill pay""), you can track your bills and make sure you have enough cash to pay them when they're due. A few alternatives available include using QUICKEN MAC 2007 or using the bill pay functionality on Quicken Bill Pay.

-----

Here's the problem - Quicken 2007 is absolute garbage - especially for those of us that enjoyed using the Windows version but have switched to Mac. We've been waiting YEARS for Intuit to give us a better product and now they're telling us to stick with Quicken 2007.  It's unforgivable.

"Very helpful and a logical arrangement.  My biggest complaint is with depreciation.  In the past (before a lot of the tax software appeared) I preferred using straightline depreciation.  It's still my preference because I then have an idea of how much I look forward to each tax year.  ACRS MACRS DDB etc. confuse the issue, but this software IMO makes it challenging to accommodate straightline depreciation.  Otherwise it's pretty good.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,1

"This is far from a full review as the tax rules are not even in place yet ... but that is not H&R Blocks fault!

I wanted to do an early estimate on taxes to determine how much of my traditional IRA I wanted to roll over to my Roth.  For that, it worked well.

I haven't yet had the opportunity to test many of the functions and forms.  At the rate our government is progressing on the rules, that probably won't happen until at least March.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,1,0
I've been using H&R Block software for probably 10 or 12 years now so I must be pretty satisfied. It's simple to use and Amazon usually offers it at a special price each year (around late December or early January) that beats all other sellers. Just watch for the daily deals.

"I knew this one sported StarForce (thanks to Amazon Reviewers with brass ones - and not intimidated by the gaming industry hyenas); yet, I found it in a electronics megamarket bin for $3 and could not resist. (Goes to show what the value of ridiculously ""protected"" games becomes in less than a year).

StarForce aside (and after subtracting 2 stars for its intrusive risk to our systems), this RTS seems undecided as to what it aimed for.
Trying to combine strategy with action is not new, WARCRAFT 3 (for one) did it much better. You have your hero (Alexander or Cleopatra) and then you build up your army to complete the corresponding campaign.
You build your base and your workers gather wood and gold. When strong enough you go (or get thrown) into battle - to earn the third resource: glory. All three are needed to advance to the next eras.

The graphics can be adequately good if run on high settings; low settings are pretty disappointing. The units are well designed though, and their movements and spilled blood give a realistic taste.

The controls will take you some time to get used to as, not only do they take up quite a chunk of the screen, but are temperamental in responding as well. Selecting units, especially in the heat of the battle, can be tricky too, as more often than not, workers receive by mistake the order to run into the front line and fight hand-to-hand with the armed enemy: an expensive short-lived sight.

The only thing that keeps this game afloat is, well, its naval warfare. Most RTS avoid them as too messy and complicated (haven't seen a solid effort since C&C: RED ALERT 2), however R&F:CaW demonstrates well designed ships, historically (more or less) accurate naval warfare techniques and quite enjoyable animations.

All in all: not a bad game that, unfortunately, is hardly worth the StarForce trouble it brings to our systems.",N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0
