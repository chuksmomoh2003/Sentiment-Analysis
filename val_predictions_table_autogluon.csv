"I was so worried to buy this product when I checked some of the other reviews. Fortunately, I decided to check the descriptions and reasons for many negative reviews before ruling out Quicken Essentials for Mac.

The Pros:
Easy to set up
Downloads and categorizes transactions from all my accounts
Easy to modify categories made automatically
Relatively inexpensive

The Cons:
Somewhat weak report generating (I probably wouldn't use the more advanced ones anyway)
Doesn't sync with TurboTax (which I'm sure is annoying for people who use it)
Not quite as customizable as the PC versions (which is annoying for me)

Basically, it's a more comprehensive version of Intuit's Mint.com. It seems less than ideal that their free service falls just short of satisfaction while their paid service for Mac is just satisfactory; however, everything I and most people really need should be covered in this program. I do recommend it for people looking for basic bookkeeping software that's easy to use. Don't worry about some of the poor reviews.

"The following applies to the standard version of Office 2008, but suppose it also applies to the Home & Student version.

I upgraded from Office 2004 to Office 2008 because Office 2004 had so many bugs in it that I could not do work sometimes.  Little things like crashing, text disappearing all by itself, formatting being impossible to fix, graphics missing parts, spurious error messages like ""This file cannot be saved because your hard disk is full""...

In Office 2008, completely updated, THE BUGS ARE EVEN WORSE than in Office 2004.  I paid 500 dollars for this?

I don't care about what ""features"" it has or does not have.  I just want to type and edit pages of text.  The bugs in Office 2008 make typing and editing even more difficult than in Office 2004.

And since the people who made this have no common sense, they made the default file formats for everything different (for example, .docx rather than .doc), so if you make a document and save it and send it to someone with any earlier version of Office, they cannot open the file.

"Bounceback Professional is the easiest and most effective utility program I ever bought for my PC.  The steps of this software is simple; just connect a backup hard drive into your PC and install the Bounceback Professional.  A very easy setup guide on the setup window (probrably 2 or 3 click of your mouse)will create a carbon-copy from your boot disk drive into your back up disk drive.  Although the first hard drive backup takes at least an hour to complete, you don't have to stand by with your PC.  Bounceback Professional will do the rest for you after you complete your setup such as creating an automatic, routine backup schedule and setting up a drive destination.

I have also experience the recovery process under this software and I have to tell you that Bounceback works like a dream.  The PC that I have to use the Bounceback Professional is the new HP media center PC (a1410n).  I have no choice but to buy an external drive in this model because it has so many components inside this particular HP tower .  Ironically, I have to perform a full disk recovery with that model because the Norton Internet Security 2006 software included in the computer package corrupt my operating system files.  To make a recovery from an external hard drive, you must use the Rescue Disk included in the Bounceback Professional package.  The Rescue CD will turn your DOS screen into a cakewalk by connecting the external drive into the USB port along with your mouse, monitor, and keyboard.  Turn on your PC, insert the Rescue CD into the CD drive, and type ""image"" once the command menu is display on your monitor.  Press ""enter"" after you type ""image"" and YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT IT(your computer of course).  The Rescue CD will do the rest of the complications for you.  Once the recovery is finish (approx. 1 hour), reboot your PC  and explore the exact copy of OS without any problems.  Amazing!

The new 2006 version of Bounceback Professional requires either internal or external hard drives that has an equivilent or more disk space than the primary hard drive.  Although I have an external hard drive for backup, internal drives performs better with Bounceback.  I prefer internal hard drive compatable towers with this product because if the operating system fails to start in your primary hard disk drive (HDD), your internal backup drive will automatically 'take over' you PC (I also use to have an internal hard drive).  The only way you can tell you drive change is to go to the ""My Computer"" icon and see your disk drive switch in reversable order (example: E: and F: is on top of C: and D:)

Overall, this is a must have if you have a lot of stuff in your computer (games, photo, music, documents, etc.).

"I run much of my work at home from my laptop. My work is very excel heavy focusing around multiple workbooks interlocked with each other on various formulas. What I require above all else is reliability. Save the flashy gimicks and give me sometthing that won't crash in the midst of a reconciliation from crew scans that can never be recovered. Below is my short opinion of what went wrong.

Graphics: Smooth transitions from formulas. Pleasing to the eye and smooth as a babies bottom. More in line with the direction of windows 8 I find myself using touch far more than with its predecessor.

Cool, so the body of the car is waxed and shiny. The problem is that you skimped on the engine. When it comes down to it the shine is only as good as the distance I can travel with it. 2013 leaves me fearful of my work. Constantly saving everything at all points as opposed to my once in a few hours approach.

Performance: HORRIBLE. I have had more crashes in Office 2013 than I have ever had in my 10+ years of using all other Office products combined. Glitches? Excel was Microsofts saving grace, a tool that stood out among all other tools. A program that you could never fully master which surprised me almost every time that I thought I did. It was the FastBack mustang of computer software. Hand me a shell and let me create my masterpiece. Efficient, dynamic, reliable only to the fault of my own errors.

Microsoft took that fastback and put out a shiny peice of junk. If the fundamentals went unchanged I would lovingly welcome the visual upgrades, however when it boils down to it I need something that I can rely on. In my opinion this version took a step in the wrong direction. It  seems to have put more into staying trendy and pretty while straying from the fundamentals that made this program so great.

Excel was Microsofts single most greatest achievement. I hope they recognize their mistakes and correct them before i'm forced to look elsewhere for business solutions.",I tried. I scoured at negative reviews but I give up.,True,1385424000,1.791759469228055,0,0

"I used TurboTax Basic for years, but will no longer use any software from Intuit.

Here's why:

1) Two attempts to nickel and dime customers. The first was eliminating the 5 free e-files from desktop products a few years back. The second was just last year when they didn't support many of the common forms in the Basic or Deluxe version. Both of these changes were reversed during the same filing season due to customers' outcries.

2) Lobbying to eliminate free government tax filing solutions such as California's CalFile and ReadyReturn. They failed in California as CalFile still exists and has incorporated many of the features of ReadyReturn. In other words, ReadyReturn was essentially replaced by a beefed up CalFile.

To be fair on point 2: Intuit's lobbying efforts are singled out by news agencies since they process the bulk of paid tax filings. It may be that other companies are lobbying either directly or indirectly, but simply aren't covered by news agencies.

To Amazon: Purchasers of products deserve to know what their money is going to. Therefore, this is a legitimate review of this product.

"I absolutely prefer Turbo Tax over H&R Block software. The software is much clearer to use and the prompts are very helpful. I was upset that Intuit decided to exclude schedules C and D this year and so had purchased H&R Block's software. H&R Block had more difficulty with my minister's housing allowance so I relented and purchased Turbo Tax 2014. It handled my housing allowance just fine as it has all the past years I've used it. I don't use schedules C or D so that feature removal didn't impact me. I definitely prefer and recommend Turbo Tax over H&R Block. I haven't used Taxcut so I can't speak to it.

An Addendum: I've been a minister for some 30 years and have always done my taxes and have never been audited, knock on wood. Because of this I have tried to stay on top of tax filing requirements for ministers. As any minister knows filing taxes as a minister is pretty complex and requires a multitude of forms and actions that many ministers cannot follow, that a non-minister cannot understand, and that many tax professionals have difficulty with, if one is to satisfy IRS requirements which is a moving target. I offered a synopsis of my experience with H&R Block's software versus Turbo Tax. I did not list every detail for brevity and because I'm not going to put all ""my business on the street"". My opinion, subjective by definition, is that Turbo Tax does a better job of handling all the ins and outs of a minister's return and does it more smoothly with better explanations.

"So this deal is great for students. Most students have used Microsoft Office 2013, or perhaps are at least familiar with the Office line of products. Most students would know what to expect. If the product line is completely new to you, then Microsoft has an office trial version (1 month) on their website if you wish to explore.

Anyhow, purchasing the product requires you to verify directly though Microsoft and not Amazon. The fun part is when you try to verify with your school e-mail and then will never send it. The instructions say to wait 24 hours for the verification e-mail, but after 4 days, it did not come.

Even worse is that Microsoft tends to have less than stellar customer support. Calling is a big waste of time (wasted almost an hour. Long holds and people who cannot assist you directly.)

After you are on the account page and you got the notification to wait 24 hours for the verification e-mail, you can click the support tab. It will take you to a page with 3 options (with green buttons.)

Surprisingly, the middle option, which takes you to a text-chat-based support, was what solved the problem. The person was able to give me a verification code directly, and all was set and done.

HOWEVER, I must WARN YOU. Office 365 University is ONLY good for 2 computers and 2 mobile devices (apparently windows phone, android, and iphone. How unseful is that?--- I would have at least expected tablets?)

This means that Amazon's NOTE about Microsoft updating their license is a bit misleading. Yes, they did update the license for use on 5 Computers and make the transferability for flexible. However, this is only for the HOME PREMIUM edition, NOT the University Edition.

I've purchased them because once you do manage to get them properly installed, they generally work well.  Without exception, however, I have found all versions of Norton to be tricky to install, re-install, and uninstall.  There have been many times where I've had to dissect my Windows registry in order to fully remove Norton so that I could install a new version.  Even then, even with clean installs, even with a clean boot-up, I always keep my fingers crossed that the whole process will work without a hitch this time.  All too often I've found myself on the Norton website searching through the tech help files trying to figure out some glitch.  I've done this because in the past I felt the results were worth all the trouble.  Even so, this is the first version of any of their programs that I have not been able to get to install no matter what I did...short of starting my computer over from scratch with a clean reformat.  Actually, I'm not willing to go quite that far for a single program when there are so many other good choices out there now.  I feel terrible about having blown $60 on this program.  It does still have some amount of usefulness considering it can be run directly from the disk.  However, using it that way deprives you of the free updates and many of the higher functions.

I expected to incur some ""learning curve"" time the first time using H&R Blocks product. However, I grossly underestimated the amount of time I would ultimately end up wasting and did not expect the H&R Block Business software to be as kludgy as it is. A few examples of the difficulties: (a) I figured out through some significant trial and error that the initial installation requires shutting down your anti-virus software firewall (the HR Block software froze several times until I figured this out, and I had to restart my computer each time to unfreeze the software), (b) processing of entries is much slower than in Turbotax, (c) the interview process is not nearly as seamless or as intuitive or as complete as the Turbotax interview process, nor is it is as visually attractive, and H&R Block's interview does not cause you to fill in every relevant blank in the 1065 (for example, the TMP's phone number); (c) the method of identifying and correcting errors in the H&R Block product is cumbersome; (d) the error review doesn't seem to pick everything up (for example, if you follow the interview process, which seems to force you to identify partner or partners having 50% or more interests before completing K-1s, you will end up reporting each of those partners twice in Schedule B-1, Part II with the result, if you have two partners at 50% interests each that you can end with a total of 200%-and the review process does not pick this up as an error); (e) you do not receive emails about efiling status and must go into the software to find out about it instead; (f) at least as to MN, the state form (in MN, Form M3 and related forms) seems to be something of an afterthought-there is no interview and you cannot rely on the software to complete all the blanks and calculations and review the entries for errors (it seems that you essentially have to use the software for MN like you would a fill-in-the blank pdf form); and (g) you cannot efile with H&R Block's software in a significant number of states, including MN (in fairness, though, I have not compared H&R Block's list with the list of states Turbotax can be used to file partnership returns in this year).
Even having now moved up the learning curve as to H&R Blocks Business tax software, I'll probably return to using Turbotax for Form 1065 use next year, particularly if Turbotax gets to be a little more competitive on price.",Kludgy partnership return software with shortcomings compared to Turbotax equivalent,True,1434240000,1.0986122886681098,0,0

Power Japanese teaches you kana (phonetic characters) very, very quickly, and introduces vocabulary to help you retain how to read (the most critical step that many books lack).

It does this while using an easy graphical interface to the point where learning all the basics doesn't even seem like a chore.

"I would like to post a review and comment on a previous review. I am a professional working in computer hardware and systems every day. I have been doing that for 29 years. There are no perfect products out there and anyone who gives an item 5 stars I would simply comment ""just wait"" as technology moves on so fast it is inevitable that a product that transfers data from one physical device usually older to a more modern physical device will eventually fail or malfunction. I have tried many products but have used Paragon Hard Disk Manager for the past 6 years and upgrade every year. Mostly I use it to clone customers failing hard drives to new (Mostly SSD) larger or newer drives and have also successfully moved entire systems to smaller drives where the ""in use"" portion would fit on a smaller drive.

However if all you want to do is clone an old drive to a new one, click on that icon and the product will walk you through a set of very intuitive stages to achieve it and it works well. It also works well to expand partitions once you have cloned a drive to a larger drive.

"Year after year, Norton provides very solid protection from online threats.  One feature that stands out is that is it very unintrusive:  You simply install it and pretty much forget it and let it work in the background.  This is very ideal to install for someone who isn't a computer expert, thus taking away most of the decision-making away from their fingertips.  It is barely a resource hog, although with the powerful machines these days, the days of anti-viruses slowing down your PCs are long over, unless you are still running an ancient system.

You no longer get a disc--You only get a code in the box!  Which makes sense because most of the time when you get a CD to install, chances are its already outdated and you have to install an update out of the gate.  This also keeps the environment cleaner.  Although why not just e-mail the code and not send me the box at this point?  You should also register this product on their website, just in case you need to re-install the CD, as the serial key is already stored there as well.

 -Cannot import proprietary Adobe Flash (.FLA) files
 -no 'formal' training classes are available (at least that I've found; but there are lots of free online forums/examples

"I got Fusion a few weeks ago, and I've been using it to virtualize my Boot Camp partition. This is great for things that don't require too much power, like updating things or running old games (e.g. Civ IV). However, my Macbook Pro only has 2 GB of RAM, so it's a bit difficult to get Windows running and keep OS X from running really damn slowly; there's a menu where you can choose how much memory and how many processors to give to the virtual machine, and it's kind of a balancing act if you want to you both systems at once. Also, this means I wouldn't even dream of really running any 3D games, unless I gave *all* of my computer's resources to the virutal machine. Nevertheless, the product did exactly what I expected it to do, and for saving me from having to reboot many times, it is awesome.

Additionally, the Fusion feature works great. Windows programs really do look like they're running side-by-side with OS X programs.

"I have no financial incentive to defend PC-Cillin, but this program has been bashed so extensively that I feel compelled to offer a counterpoint view of someone with positive experience.

When at the end of 2006 Trend Micro introduced PC-Cillin Internet Security 2007, I was planning to upgrade (PC-Cillin 2006 worked very well for me). However, the new 2007 version drew heavy criticism from numerous users, who reported the software to be buggy and unstable. It appeared that Trend Micro had rushed an unfinished product to the market.

So I decided to wait. In the interim, I tried out Microsoft Live OneCare (see my review on that). While it was easy on computer resources and had a pleasing interface, the program lacked many features that I was used to being a former PC-Cillin user, and it was overall too unrefined in its performance to justify the $50 price tag.

Now I am back to PC-Cillin, whose updated version was released in February 2007. Feeling cautious, I first downloaded and tried out the 30-day evaluation version from Trend Micro Web Site, before finally purchasing the full package. I am pleased to report that whatever instability issues the software suffered from in its initial release seem to have been fixed. It is better than its predecessor (Internet Security 2006), with extensive customization features and phishing protection.

Beware, the program does eat your RAM (utilizing a whopping 125 Mb of memory, according to the Task Manager).  A system with inadequate memory will get constipated by PC-Cillin.  My computer is 1.8 GHz Pentium 4.  It had 256 Mb of RAM when I installed PC-Cillin, and even though it got more sluggish, it was still by no means crawling along, -- just slower.  I went ahead and upgraded to 512 Mb RAM, and since then have experienced no slowdown issues whatsoever.  Trend Micro specifies a minimum requirement of 128 Mb for your computer RAM.  This number is frankly unrealistic, as the program will eat every last kilobyte of your memory, leaving the rest of your computer to exist off the virtual memory on the hard drive.  So, in my experience, 256 Mb RAM has been adequate, but 512 Mb is the amount you really need (on Windows XP) to efficiently run PC-Cillin in the background.

The interface has become more colorful and appealing. Menus and root submenus may take some time getting used to, but to me this was not an issue, as I previously used PC-Cillin 2006 and was familiar with the layout.

The widely reported incompatibility issues between Lavasoft Adaware and PC-Cillin 2007 must have been resolved in this version, as both programs run fine alongside each other on my computer without interference. As far as Windows stability goes, I use Windows XP Pro, and it has incorporated PC-Cillin well. No offense to other operating systems, but I wonder whether many of the users who have had or still having problems with PC-Cillin are using a less stout OS (like Windows Media).

I am not going to repeat the information listed in the overview provided by the vendor. Suffice it to say that the advertized features seem to work well. Spyware detection has been beefed up to the point that Lavasoft scans report clean system in the wake of PC-Cillin scans (last year Lavasoft would routinely find little tidbits overlooked by PC-Cillin). I don't particularly care for Trend Secure Online Services included in this subscription, but I suppose someone else might find them useful. This is also the first year that PC-Cillin offers protection against root kits (although I have no idea how effective or extensive this protection may be).

Cannot attest to the technical support, as I have had no reason to contact them. The program works and works well for me. This is a welcome change from Norton and Windows Live OneCare.

I like the fact that PC-Cillin regularly scans the system for Windows and Microsoft Office vulnerabilities and, if needed, provides references to Microsoft sites from which I can download patches. It also keeps extensive logs of everything that has transpired with the computer and Internet connection, which occasionally, I suppose, may come useful, although I have not had any need for it.

Overall, I have been pleased with PC-Cillin Internet Security 2007. If price were a bit lower (not everyone needs a 3-user license) and if it didn't slow the system down at all, I would have given it 5 stars. Even then, it is a solid and very customizable security suite. I recommend it, and I don't even get anything from Trend Micro for saying so.

"First, I purchased the download version from Amazon. The download was an old rev. There were major problems installing in Win 8. I did find some solutions online that wasted some hours and finally got it installed but then many errors were reported when opening my previous version company files. Further, the auto-update feature didn't work and couldn't download the updates! What I wish I had discovered first rather than last was that the latest full version can be downloaded from Intuit and that it installs without any issues and works just fine - instead I wasted hours figuring out how to work around the old version problems! (I would have called Tech Support, but it was after their working hours that end very early in my work day!!! How come they always seem to have gone home half hour before I need them?!!)

Looking at the list of latest full version downloads on Intuit's website, Quickbooks Accountant appears at first to be missing but actually it's hiding under the Premiere edition - open up the Premier section to find it. It installs and runs and opens my restored companies with no problems. Its seems the name of the product is now or was or is sometimes referred to as Quickbooks Premiere Accountant Edition.

I'm quite disappointed with the new color scheme, the poorly designed layout and display of information inside windows (e.g. often it will show only a few characters of an item name and you have to make the window MUCH bigger to see enough of the text yet all the other data in the window fits in the normal sized window).  It augments excellently to the frustrations of also being new to Windows 8 - knowing what I want is in there somewhere but not quite being able to find it when I easily could in the well-honed older versions - I suspect conspiracy!

It's too soon for me to pass an opinion on feature improvements, I'm actually new to the Accountant version, but hopefully the above will help some people avoid wasting the several hours I did.

Having two company files open at once is going to be very useful. Too bad they both look dark grey and the information being displayed is not as intuitively obvious as it used to be. If you're also new to Windows 8, I'd book some stress relief activities in advance and download a free utility to add back the start button! Hopefully someone will make a utility to add back the window colors and smaller font sizes in Quickbooks also!

The tricks and stunts Intuit pull to try to get you to sign up to their cloud-syncing service is also dismaying. The same types of tricks are played by Microsoft with Windows 8. I personally think some CEO's should go to jail for stuff like this. Should an accountant be allowed to choose to share his customer's financial data with Intuit's cloud? I can see some obvious and valuable reasons FOR syncing, but this info is often the last stuff that many businesses would choose to risk sharing, no matter how secure the cloud is promised to be, time after time cloud services have exhibited gaping security issues. If companies like Intuit and Microsoft resort to multiple tricks and manipulation to get you to share all your most sensitive company and customer information with them, they surely have some unspoken motivation.

UPDATE 6/2013. Intuit did provide an update so now you can add some (limited and frankly still ugly) color to the windows, you can have different color windows for different companies, so that's an improvement. The problems with wasted space while not being able to e.g. see sufficient item name data are still there.","Some backwards esthetics, AVOID WINDOWS 8 INSTALL PROBLEMS!",True,1360281600,2.6390573296152584,0,1

"I bought this some time ago, installed it, found it difficult to use and set it aside for a few months. Came across it the other day and decided to give it another try. One word suffices to describe every aspect of this product: awful.

When reinstalling it, the installer warned me that I had exceeded the number of installs allowed. Excuse me? This was the second time I installed it on the same machine. Fortunately, Nero allows you to tell its guardian that it is a reinstall. Why isn't the software intelligent enough to recognize that it is being installed on the same machine?

Next, I learned something I should have spotted before I purchased this product: it only works with certain devices. Nero claims that Move It will recognize your device automatically and set everything up for transfers, making it oh so simple for the end user. Nero claims to support 150 devices. You cannot actually add a device unsupported by Nero. Well, look at the list of devices Nero support: it reads like a roster of dead technology, of devices that have gone to the great beyond.

 Do you have a Nokia N800, a two year old device? Not recognized by Nero. How about the year old HP Ipaq 211? Not recognized by Nero. Or let's take the Sansa View, which has exactly the same requirements as the SanDisk Sansa Fuze, which is recognized. Well, the view - despite its identical requirements - is not recognized.

 Allegedly you can create parameters for an unlisted device, but try as I might, I could not do it. I did find one way of dealing with transferring to other devices not on Nero's list of museum pieces if they have removable SD, microSDHC or CF cards. You can set the user settings to recognize those devices, though the process is somewhat convoluted. Not that it will necessarily do you a lot of good. Nero Move It's video formats are quite restrictive and won't work with devices like the Nokia N800.

 The approach Nero has taken is just plain dumb. Making it difficult, if not impossible, to define devices not on Nero's list of antiques (for the most) part is beyond dumb.

 I've used Nero itself for  a long time. I've skipped upgrading it because of the many poor reviews to be found on Amazon.

 Nero Move It, judging from the number of Amazon reviews, is selling poorly - and frankly I can understand why: it is just plain awful. If I were given to such things, there are a couple of four-letter words I could use to accurately describe this product.

"I have been a user and advocate of Quicken since 1995, and have faithfully upgraded each year. Since 2000 I have been running Quicken on a Compaq Presario 1800T laptop (192MB Mem, Windows Me). After installing Quicken 2003 Basic last year, I started experiencing occasional screen freezes, which could only be corrected by a system restart.
This year, egged on by a nice rebate, and the requirement to move from Basic to something better (for transaction downloads and 401K tracking), I upgraded to Quicken 2004 Premier.  Little did I know, that the problems I had with Quicken 2003 would be exaggerated in Quicken 2004.
What a change for the worse this upgrade has been. A data-entry session that used to take me 5 minutes, now takes 15, as typically, I will have to reboot my PC two or three times during the process.  I have submitted a bug report, describing three issues characterized by Windows blue screens, screen freezes, and spurious Exceptions in Windows system processes.  These issues are only apparent on my system when Quicken is running.
My conclusion.  Windows ME, the Compaq laptop's hardware/video drivers and Quicken 2004 Premier, when combined, do not make a good match.  The last stable Quicken version I used on this platform was Quicken 2002. On the positive side I do like the features that Quicken has to offer, but in my case, this is outweighed by the negative effect of an unstable installation. My ray of hope is that some of these problems may be fixed in the next patch release.

"I've used this software for about 10 years.  Though I would normally give it only 3 stars because it doesn't do much to clarify the IRS Tax Code, but it does do most of the math for your.  In many cases I still have to dig through IRS Instructions to figure out what I'm supposed to enter.  I keep using it year after year because I guess I'm a masochist.

As to why I gave it two stars...

I probably should have given it only one star because this really could be disastrous.
Anyway, when I finished my taxes I discover that I nearly underpaid last year.  So decided to update my W4.  I usually don't touch it because I have no idea what the allowances mean other than that it will increase or decrease my withholding.  So, I decided to wade through the planner part of the software when I was done with my taxes  I'd never used it before.  It was basically like doing your taxes again with guesses for this year, but the result this time would be a single digit number plus an amount for a few dollars to put in your W-4.  It also tells you about how much Income Tax needs to be taken out of your paycheck each paycheck.

I wasn't too surprised that it said I needed to take an additional $100 out each pay period.  But the allowance number it came up with was 2 MORE than what I was currently withholding.  The additional withholding amount was only $10  I admit that I find how this number is achieved is a great mystery, but I'm pretty sure (after I looked it up today) that the higher that number the the LESS they take out!  Just to double check, I found a web site ([...]) that explains how to work backward from the magic number to get what's really being taken out.  The amount for me would have been $200 LESS than I currently take out each paycheck!  I tried the magic number calculators on the IRS web site as well as on H&R Block's own web site to see if they gave me something different.  Each said I needed to take about the same amount as the software did but they each gave me a allowance number 2 less than was currently on my W4.

So, Beware!  If you blindly follow what it tells you to do, you can end up paying a huge penalty next year!  I really hope the rest of the software is more reliable.

I haven't tried any other software, but I think I will next year.

"A highly sophisticated, user-adaptable intuitive system for professionals billing by time and expense; clearly written by hands-on pros aided by top-notch programmers. Once you get it working, it is awesome in breadth and depth, yet, for all its power, reasonable priced. So why not five stars?

Because it is hamstrung by a chaotic, rambling, disorganized and at times inconsistent 'Guide', making ""Billings"" seem far more complicated than intended; thereby discouraging rapid acceptance by office personnel. Frustrated, I ended up printing the in-program Help topics one-by-one, like a beta tester  ... a needless waste of time and effort.

Once you get the hang of it (though many hours later), the Billings program rates a five-star 'as good as they get'. Much time, effort and thought have gone into making 'Billings' user-friendly and in designing attractive invoice templates.

"I'm usually a fan of Toast, but this release is very disappointing. I was looking forward to burning Blu_rays from my High-Def video cameras. Unfortunately, so far this has not been possible due to crashes every time it tries to encode video.

Not only does it crash frequently, it is very slow. Not in terms of heavy-duty stuff like encoding video - but trivial things like the interface response time, and startup time.

I had been using Toast 7, which is fast, convenient and reliable. It is one of the better Mac applications around. And I'm actually still using Toast 7, and will until they get the bugs out of Toast 9 and get the video encoder burning working properly.

I couldn't even get Toast 9 to recognize a perfectly valid disk image. So I went back to Toast 7 and it worked perfectly. I'm seriously wondering how this one got past quality control.

"We used it extensively during our tour to Germany and Austria last year. We were pleasantly surprised when our car had a built-in GPS but we used this one thru the entire trip in addition to the built-in one.

Pros:
- Maps are accurate. In places, the latest updates were not on it. On the trip to Burg Eltz from Koblenz, this map gave an extended distance but the built-in GPS had a direction that was quicker. I checked that one particular road was not on this map. For the rest of the trip, the two routes were almost the same.
- POI is very decent

Cons:
- My GPS took a while to get the first lock. It might be a GPS issue than the map.
- Some of the POI is hard to find due to the spellings. I suggested that you find and load them ahead of time. Also, keep the GPS coordinates handy as you might not find all the POI.

Overall, we would have been fine with it. I would recommend it to a friend or family member. The maps are getting better with every passing year.",Works but not as good as the European GPS on the cars there!,True,1392854400,0.0,1,1

"Background:  I installed Quicken 2014 Premier over a month ago as an upgrade from Q2011 Premier and have been using Quicken since the 1990s.  I waited for about 5 weeks to write this review so I could go through all my typical transactions and write a thorough review instead of just ripping Inuit a new one like so many reviews on here.  I urge you to read reviews and not just look at the ""star rating"" because some of these reviews are by people who haven't even used Q2014.

Review:  I find it difficult to give this product one rating so I will highlight different areas for your consideration.

Overview: On one hand Quicken is the only substantial desktop personal finance software available since MS Money left the market place.  If you need to or want to manage your personal finances this is a must have (5 stars).

First Time User:  If you are starting from scratch (not converting from a prior version) I would highly recommend this product even though Intuit is still working out some bugs.  My perception is that many of the issues I see posted on message boards are related to converted data or corrupt data files.

Upgrading:  If you are currently using Quicken 2012 or 2013 I would not give this version 2 stars because I don't see the value in paying for this version over the 2012 or 2013 version.  The only major functionality added is to keep your finances in the cloud and improved budgeting.  That said, the mobile apps that interact with your data file saved in the cloud have many limitations and problems.  Unless you are a traveler staying on the road for weeks at a time and don't want your data file on a laptop I don't see the value in putting your finances on the cloud and using your phone/tablet.  Just download your data daily and you'll have everything up to date every day.  As for the budgeting there appear to be many bugs. If you are a person who likes to budget I would suggest what I do.  Create a spreadsheet for the budget and actuals.  This allows you to budget in whatever period (e.g. monthly, weekly, yearly, etc) you want and at whatever level you want (e.g. category level, sub-category level, mixed level with some summary and some at sub-category, or aggregated categories) and then each month run a report that lists your expenditures.  The problem with budgeting that I think Quicken is running into is trying to be everything for everyone and budgeting is so personalized you'll be happier using a spreadsheet which is what I do.

My experience:  When I upgraded Quicken on Windows 7 Quicken converted my 2011 data file to 2014 with no issues.  I was sure to validate my data file first to make sure it was ""clean.""  The conversion process was pretty straight forward and didn't take more time than I thought was reasonable for the amount of data in my file.  Prior to upgrading I ran most of my reports and took about 50 screen prints to ensure if I had data problems in the conversion I could find and fix them.  To my surprise all transactions and balance converted with no discrepancies. Overall there are too many bugs release for my liking so I would rate the state of the current software at 3.5 stars.  There are some differences between the way Q2011 and Q2014 look and feel as follows (note that I don't know if these changes were inserted in Q2012, Q2013, or Q2014).
 - Colors and icons have changed.
 - Downloaded and scheduled transactions are now denoted by separate icons (flag for downloaded transactions and clock for scheduled transactions)
 - The speed of entering transactions and moving between different accounts seems to be slower.
 - The Property & Debt (including Loans) section has been largely revamped with more graphs and handling of loans.  Some people don't like this but I think it is a positive step but there are still some bugs that need to be worked out.
 - Ability to close accounts is awesome.  For example, close a credit card and then close it in Quicken so you are not bothered with it again.
 - There are some changes to the way scheduled transactions function.  One is that you can have them displayed in your register as scheduled transactions instead of in a separate section below the register. I'm not a fan but some people really like this.
 - You can add buttons in the upper right section of a register (next to the gear dropdown) that allows you to have short cuts to various functions (e.g. reconcile, account attachments, etc).  I personally really like this.

Overall you'll find additional things that you like or don't based on how you conduct your finances.

Summary: If you want to manage your personal finances Quicken is the only game in town even if it has some bugs and forces you to upgrade every 3 years.  I could not manage my finances without it.  Hope this review helps your decision/understanding.",A lot of good and some bad. Hard to provide 1 rating.,True,1383609600,1.6094379124341005,1,1

"There is a lot going for Word Perfect's Office Suite.  If you have a font embedded PDF, you can open it up and do some editing.  If you want to publish e-books, it has a built in publisher.  You can customize your ribbon to select your most used functions to be favored. These functions are really great when you are in the word processing system, if you need them.  Outstanding even.  But after that, the suite as a whole begins to fade in value compared to the ubiquitous Microsoft Office Word.  Though you can exchange files in the word format, I have seen some formatting issues when more than simple type is involved. This drives you to PDF sharing and if you are in a big office the file most requested on a work in progress is word.

Further, the rest of the suite does not rise to the power and flexibility of Power Point or the KING of all spread sheets, Excel. You definitely gain an advantage in functionality within Word Perfect's word processing system compared to MS Word, and if you are not in a Word world and do not really use the other programs of a suite, this becomes a really good buy -- especially if you want to quickly integrate your work into e-published books - but if you need the full functionality of complex and entertaining slide based presentations, or the unlimited math functions and displays for your spread sheets, Corel fails to come close to the usability of Microsoft.","Shines where it is at its best, but falls short if you need all the functionality of an office suite.",False,1466208000,0.0,1,0

"I was looking for a lettering program that would go beyond the built-in capabilities of my Janome. Most people feel the Em***d product was the way to go but I disagree. I found BuzzWord much more intuitive and user friendly - if you are familiar with Microsoft Windows applications. First, download the free 21 day trial version because it will give you a good feel for the product. Check out the Youtube videos for help in performing tasks.

With BuzzWord, you can add lettering around designs following a vertical, horizontal, circular, or freeform path. You select the type of path you want, place it around your design, then type in the letters. They will appear along the path you defined. You can adjust size, slant, boldness, spacing between letters, and other attributes of the included fonts. Keep moving things around or tweaking settings until you are happy with what you see.

If you have pre-digitized fonts, BuzzWord will let you map them to your keyboard so when you type the letters, they appear on the path you defined. Remember, pre digitized fonts cannot be sized or changed in apprerance like the included fonts can. That's not a limitation of the application, it's just how things work in the font world.

The program includes 30 fonts which can be sized - the largest I did was 1 1/2 inches and it came out fine. When you look at the included fonts on their web page, a lot of them don't look so good. I created 3 large hoop designs with 10 font samples per design, and stitched them all out. Almost all of them looked very good in my opinion. I don't know why you would need more than 30, but my requirements are modest.

In addition to lettering, BuzzWord has some bonus features they don't hype. First, you can combine several designs into a hoop outline to create a new design. You don't need to add any lettering. Also, if you select different areas of a design, you can change the color or delete them. Let's say you have a teddy bear design with stars around it. You can change the color of the stars or remove them from the design. Or, if you have a design with text you don't like, remove it and add your own. This editing capability is limited, but if I can ""select"" (with the selection tool) parts of a design, I can modify them.

"Windows 8 is excellent. Besides Android 4.2 Jellybean (which is actually a flavor of Linux) Windows 8 is the best operating system around. It is truly the first great operating system that works on tablets and PC without needing a separate OS. Most devices will become a touch screen in the future anyway so it is great that Microsoft is working ahead of the curve to get people used to the way things will be. A track pad on a laptop CAN be slightly oversensitive though when you first try using it in windows 8. You swipe your finger SLOWLY left to right in the center and you swipe between screens like Alt + tab always has. You want a traditional desktop? It is right there on the START screen. Click on it. You want a start button? Microsoft has recently added one back from the looks of it but it is really pointless in the new OS. Just push the WINDOWS BUTTON on your keyboard which is the START BUTTON. It is great! The OS is more stable than ever and a great improvement on Windows 7 and Windows 7 was a great product. It only takes about a half hour or so to get used to the new features and then you will not want to turn back. The apps in the Windows Store are also multiplying. The quality of the graphics are even better than iPad and Android on many of the apps that have been ported over.

Now to be more subjective about the subject. With technology you always have to learn new features and ways of doing things. The earlier you do the better. Microsoft you have done well. Keep up the good work. You are moving in the right direction to stay up to date with new products and features. Well done.",Windows 8 is excellent,False,1370131200,1.3862943611198906,1,1
"I bought this because my Palm Pilot and new I Touch would not sync up with my older version of Outlook.  The good news: they both synched up!
The bad news:  There is a slew of new menus to learn to do the simplest of Word, Excel, or Power Pt functions.  For example, the icon to open a file in Word or Excel is not displayed.  You can add it to a teeny menu if you like (took a while to find that).  Other menus are set.  For instance in ""Home"" menu mode, half the menu is taken up with ""Style.""  You can't get rid of it that I know of.  Then there was that heart stopping moment when I did get to the open screen and found none of my old Word documents there.  I had to select 1997-2003.  Phew.  Of course Word reminds me that I'm using that mode all the time.
I guess my point is: Was there an effort to make this compatible in format and use for the average user or was this designed for professional keyboarders?

Well, I've got to advise you to skip this one. I sure wish I had.

Here's a problem I just dealt with moments ago that motivated me to write this.

I have a mortgage. I pay it out of my checking account every month. This month, the automatically entered transaction in Quickengot applied backwards on the mortgage account. So the $2400 check out of my checking account, according to quicken, increased the amount I owe by $2400 while also decreasing my checking account balance that same amount.

This clearly isn't right. I then adjusted the entry in the checking account to 2400.01 and saved it, and the effect flipped in the mortgage account, and the loan balance went down like it should. I then took the penny back off (so it reflects the actual payment amount) and all was fine.

"This is my first negative review ever.

I purchased Nero 2014 Platinum directly from nero.com to rip my personal CD's and get the metadata including the album cover art from Gracenote automatically. Something Nero claims on their Web site their software does (and their older versions did):

When ripping, can I collect album art, song titles and album automatically?

Yes, with Gracenote, the standard in music recognition technology. Gracenote integration lets you instantly retrieve song titles, album names, track numbers and album art from a database of more than 100 million songs.

http://www.nero.com/enu/support/#n2014pla::FAQ:gracenote

When actually doing the ripping, their software shows the album cover art that it automatically retrieved from Gracenote along with the artist, title and track name. BUT, it will not save the album cover art in the files you rip, regardless of format, be it MP3 or FLAC. When I contacted Nero customer support as to why it won't save the album cover art in the ripped track they responded with:

Dear Mr.xxxxxx,

thank you for your e-mail.

You can use the Gracenote database information in your Nero applications, you can`t safe it in your files or burn this information to disk. This is not possible because of a legal problem.

Should you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to contact us again.

"The box says you can ""Quickly start speaking, reading, and writing French.""  Well, though it does have tutorials on quickly picking up the language, it has nothing to show a beginner how to pronunciate the letters and accents.
The first program, Tell Me More, is all French with no English translation.  This is four of the 7 CD's that only helps someone review French that already knows it.  Example, it'll show you a picture of a boy and a soccer ball, then have some French text and prounce the text in French.  You don't know if they're saying ""Boy with Ball"", ""Boy Playing Soccer"", ""Boy Playing"" or what.  Does no good for a beginner.
The French Plus CD is a different product and like the Tell Me More is more of a review for those who already know French.
The French Vocabulary Builder is basically a dictionary that pronounces certain words, but again, no syntax on how French is setup... so still no go for a beginner.
And the final CD is an audio CD, which again, isn't for the beginner.

So that she & I ""are on the same page"", i ordered the 2008 (not Deluxe) program & installed it in my computer.  Come to find-out, the only thing the Deluxe program differs from this program is something called ""photo-Power"".  I have only tried to use this feature once & found it confusing & cumbersome.  In the older version, I installed with limited capabilities.  I can see all the cards already created in the program, but if I want to use one, I have to insert one of the CDs from the program.  A window opens to tell which CD must be inserted.  With this program, once it's installed with the ""installation wizard"", no need to insert a CD!  At times, I have misplaced my 2007 disc container.  It turns-up quickly, usually.  If I have any complaint, it would be there is no way to make cards to fit ""regular"" & ""legal"" size envelopes - only quarter-fold & half-fold.  But, the 2008 program has a few more projects hat were not in the 2007 version.  I have not tried creating any of them, yet, however.

Without going into detail here, I had to contact Serif due to a program crash.  I emailed Serif, exchanged emails, sent a copy of my project, and was asked to call to speak to a technician. Ultimately, the technician connected remotely (safely and securely) to my computer, went thru some diagnostics, and discovered the problem. This all resolved in less than a half hour. The techs were super understanding and patient and absolutely gave me the impression they were there to help me.  Oh, I should mention that if you buy thru Amazon, you should keep a record of your key code sticker, as the technicians couldn't find me as easily as if I bought directly from Serif.

"The Her Interactive Nancy Drew games have improved with each new release. Nancy Drew Treasure in the Royal Tower is the perfect combination of mystery and complications. The puzzles on the Junior level aren't so hard, that they drive you crazy, but not so easy that you scoff. The mystery is intriguing and exciting. Each  suspect was more suspicious as the game went on, and only the smoothest of detectives will be able to predict who is the culprit!
This mystery has less holes then Secrets can Kill, and each new clue leads to the next. It has the excellent case of 'Mansion' and the complex characters of Stay Tuned for Danger. I rarely found myself at a loss for places to go or people to talk to.
A true Nancy Drew mystery, with everything from sneaking into a locked up room, to questioning the suspects about everything!

Be observant and stay on your toes...you never know, that little out of place panel or odd door, may lead you to the successful ending to the case!
Hint: Remember to stay calm, puzzles and upseting happenings should always make you think harder, not frantically. Also, thoroughly search every room for a hint or clue.

"O.K.  Quicken Premier 2014 has had a ton of negative press.  Some of this is kind of justified, however, some of this may be due to operator error on the part of the customers.  I've used Quicken products for ~ 15 years now and, while it is a bit of a love-hate relationship, it is many orders of magnitude better to use this product than to use something else like Mint, or a spreadsheet, or other.

First, you must download the updates manually.  Their instructions for automatic downloads simply don't work.  Go to their website and download the updates manually just as they tell you to do.  Don't attempt to follow their instructions about updating Quicken 2014 from inside the program.  It won't work.  This is a MUST.  Without doing this update, you'll be living the life of a caveman.  My quicken went instantly from a release 1.0 to something like release 5.0.  I didn't attempt to do anything inside of quicken until I got past this hurtle.

Now, what you get, is a program that works by syncing up most credit cards and most bank accounts, to your computer and to your smart phone.  Attachments of photographs of receipts to the items, syncing up to investment accounts and tracking all expenses is relatively easy.  More on the smart phone in a minute.

We use the expense tracking features on quicken and create reports about all our expenses for the previous 12 months and it is imperative that this be done accurately as we are using this as a tool to determine if we can retire soon.  Quicken does this well as all  the individual purchases in our credit cards are automatically downloaded from their respective banks.  Setting this up is fairly smooth inside quicken.  Setting up categories is also smooth.  Accidentally having duplicate categories is also smooth. :)  This problem is fairly easily fixed their their category  editing tool.

Regarding the smart phone app.  I have a Google Nexus 4 with Android operating system and T-mobile. I have been using the application for about 4 weeks now and have synced up the transactions to the phone and back again many times.  I've edited the category on the phone and observed the result in the computer after syncing.  I have photographed receipts and attached the photos to the item in the app in the phone, synced and then observed the receipts in the computer.

"[Review last updated on 15 June 07 - see my exchange with Stewart in the 2 comments just below]

The point of my review is simply this: if installation goes smoothly and there are no serious error messages within the first 4-7 days, you're in good hands. Otherwise, don't persist in attempting to fix the error through repeated installation, for this might make matters even worse.

Having used Symantec  / Norton products like SystemWorks, Utilities, Anti-Virus, Ghost, Partition Magic, pcAnywhere, etc., with overall satisfaction and confidence for many years now, I downloaded Norton 360 and  began upgrading all 3 of our laptops starting on  8th May 07. While I have little doubt that this new suite, entirely rethought  from ground up, deserves all the rave reviews it has received from ZDNet (CNet), PCMagazine, Laptop Magazine, etc., it's also become evident that this first-generation can be highly unstable in many (unpredictable) system configurations, affecting performance (hogging resources), interfering with low-level Windows drivers and system files (repeated and serious fault messages from basic services), eventually resulting in recurring crashes with memory dumping. Norton 360 does attempt to correct itself though LiveUpdate  and can even succeed in doing so (as it did on 2 of the machines on which it has been running smoothly and unobtrusively in the background till now. But it has caused havoc on my wife's SONY VAIO PCG-R505JS laptop with 384MB of RAM. We continued to receive critical Windows XP error messages even after entirely uninstalling 360, eventually resulting in the notebook becoming completely unusable as of 26th May (see below).

Here's some advice based on some rather painful experiences:

* Make sure you completely uninstall all previous Norton products with similar or overlapping functionality before installing 360. Use first the Add/Remove components from the XP Control Panel, reboot, then remove LiveUpdate as well, and reboot again. Then download the Symantec Removal  Tool from their website, and run it to ensure that whatever remained is also erased. Otherwise, you may get repeated errors even while 360 download is attempting to extract the files from the installation package.  Repeating this procedure has finally got 360 running on the other 2 laptops. I'd now also recommend you ensure that there are no latent (preexisting) system-level faults that could surface subsequently, by running ChkDisk, defragmenting your hard drive, etc., and installing all available Windows Updates.

*  Installation on my wife's SONY has been a disaster. After the sorts of difficulties described above, I finally succeeded in installing 360 and it seemed to be running smoothly for a couple of days. Then it suddenly displayed a message that there was something seriously wrong with the installation, and directing to uninstall and reinstall, which I did. After some time, I noticed that the 360 icon was no longer appearing on the System Tray and the program wouldn't launch from the Start Menu, but seemed to be still hogging resources (out of virtual memory errors, etc.). So another uninstall and reinstall followed yesterday. Since then things have gone from bad to worse, with  critical Windows system errors, crashes, memory dumping, and corruption of system files. This is continuing even after 360 installation has now been completely erased along with registry entries, etc.  In her case, I suspect there were system-level problems (such as file corruption) even before attempting the first 360 install (see above) If you start noticing the whole system slowdown with critical Windows message, you might consider uninstalling before critical data files are mysteriously deleted or lost (as happened with her Outlook.pst file). On 26 May, we decided to completely reformat the hard-drive and reinstall Win XP, but were unable to do so because of the quirky behavior (not due to 360!) of the only bootable CD-ROM drive on the docking-station (neither would it allow us to complete the system recovery procedure back to original factory condition).

Based on its satisfactory performance on my other two laptops (there have been occasional problems, even leading to shutdowns, but 360 has succeeded in fixing itself...so far), I suspect that it might take Symantec up to even 6-12 months to discover and fix problems with 360 running on configurations other then the typical ones they had tested it under before release. Given its reasonable cost (for 3 computers), otherwise streamlined features (less obtrusive in principle), and effectiveness in catching viruses, etc. (see the reviews), it's worth checking out. However, if you encounter such problems, play it safe and do not attempt a reinstall until after a few months at least (after release of major patches from Symantec).

I also feel that Symantec needs to maintain a dedicated and regularly updated FAQ /blog on Norton 360 troubleshooting, if it wants to retain customer confidence in a product that otherwise shows much promise.

The net result of the 360 installation has been that we had to buy a new laptop with Vista Home (and 60-day trial of Norton Internet Security = NIS) pre-installed. On 14 June, I upgraded this new machine to Vista Home Premium. The same day, reassured by 360's satisfactory performance to date on our other 2 laptops,  I uninstalled NIS ( without removing existing Live Update),  successfully installed 360,  and completed the otherwise pending scans, etc., manually to ensure there were no problems. Finally,  I let 360 wirelessly back up selected files and folders (including photos and music =  totaling 1.6 GB) overnight to the Symantec's free 2 GB online storage.

So we now have 360 running efficiently and unobtrusively on 3 different laptops on Windows XP, Vista Home  Premium, and Vista Ultimate.

I create user interfaces and user experiences for the products I work on.

"Toast has always been the best burning software on the Mac and this version is no exception. I had skipped over version 7 and wasn't sure about getting version 8 since I had the impression that much of what Toast does is already built into the Mac. Boy was I wrong. What comes with the OS, iTunes and iDVD barely scratches what Toast 8 can do. There's a reason why people continue to recommend this as a must have app on the Mac - it's gone way beyond burning of CDs and DVDs.

Likes:
* Data Spanning - a must have for EVERYONE - if you have files that are too big to fit onto a CD or a DVD (and it's really pretty easy to have this now... think video files or your iTunes library) Toast splits them and burns a piece onto every disc.... and you can take those discs to any Mac or PC to use them.
* Burn Catalog - this is cool - it keeps track of the contents of your discs - so you can see what's on them - even when the discs aren't in the computer anymore. I love this one...
* Music DVD - puts 1000 songs on a regular DVD so you can play it in your home theater system and see menus and album info while the song is playing.
* Photo Disc - my wife loves this one... makes great looking photo disc slideshows to send to PC users
* EyeTV - I use EyeTV to get TV shows onto the Mac - and this is THE ONLY way to burn DVDs of your recorded show - and it's fast.
* DIVX - I like to download DiVX files but iDVD can't turn them into DVDs - but this Toast can
* DVD copying - Roxio put all of the other product Popcorn into Toast  - so if you want to copy DVDs or convert DVDs for iPod... don't get Popcorn - get this.
* Labeler - I like to make case inserts of the DVDs I burn and this labeler in Toast is really top notch.
* Printed manual - YES you read this right, it comes with a printed user guide... how cool is that?!

Dislikes:
* New look - I'm not such a huge fan of the ""new and improved"" UI... I was used to the old one in Toast 6 and it will take some time to get used to the new... I guess that the price you pay for progress.

Overall I'm really happy with this purchase. There aren't too many other apps you need to use the Mac, but this is one of them I think.

First of all, my system resources can't handle moving the pictures so while I click and drag, the screen doesn't keep up and I have no idea where the picture or item will end up. It's not very precise this way. The website's solution is to use my arrow keys. Ok, so maybe that's a problem with my computer. Second, I can't select photos easily because it brings up images that are too small to see the detail. And that's with the LARGE thumbnails. So in a photo of a group of 12 kids, I have to have the photo pre-selected. Not how I planned on putting together a scrapbook when I have thousands of photos to look through. Also, in researching the screen freeze issue I discovered that I can only have up to 10 pages in a scrapbook. Also not my part of my original plan. My advice would be to go to the designers website and look at the FAQ's before buying. It helps you to see any issues before you buy.

"I wish that I had read the review by Thomas before ordering QuickBooks as well.  I am experiencing the exact thing.  I ordered the PC disk version for 2015 QuickBooks from Amazon. We have been a loyal Intuit software users for many many years (I believe using QuickBooks and other Intuit products since the early 1980s) but have never had any major problems and always rated Intuit products above all other similar products . . . always receiving a 5+.  In fact, I have continuously over the years referred QuickBooks and other Intuit software to many individuals and businesses as the software of choice.
  I placed the order on May 30 and received it June 9.  The slowest delivery I have ever had to deal with from Amazon.  Very excited to finally to receive the product, I immediately opened it and started the software installation.  I had to upgrade to continue to use my payroll subscription so for several weeks I patiently waited for my QuickBooks to arrive.  At this point, I was very excited to play catch up with all the work that I had to hold until I received my new software.  Now it was time to enter the License Number and Product Number.  After searching for the information for a while, I finally was able to locate it on the box.  In the past, the number was also located within the documents but not this time.  When I attempted to carefully peel back the gold label, the label stuck to the product number and license number which ripped some of the numbers away. Apparently, the tape holding the gold label had gotten hot and tightly glued itself onto the product number and license number. I immediately call Intuit/QuickBooks for support.  Told the operator several times what had happened and that I could not see the first set of numbers for the license number and the first set of numbers for the product number.  Due to a language barrier, apparently she did not understand me because she continued to ask me for the license number and product number.  After some time on the phone with the operator and explaining my circumstance, she tells me that she cannot help me but would set up a case number for me and that she was not sure if they would be able to help me since I ordered it through Amazon.  Much disappointed, I asked her how soon should I expect to hear from someone since this is a very urgent matter for me.  She said between 24 to 72 hours.  Yes, it would take them that long to get back to me with no guarantee that they could help me because I bought it from Amazon.  QuickBooks my software of choice has truly let me down.  Many hours and many conversations for many years with QuickBooks support have never made me feel this badly. I always have had a pleasant experience and always felt like a winner after talking with the support team.
  So, I am still waiting for a phone call back in hope they will be able to help me and that I will not have to spend nearly $200 again to purchase another copy of 2015 QuickBooks Pro.  What a situation?  Guess that is the kind of support I should expect since I purchased it online from Amazon.  If I had purchased it at a local store, I am sure that I could have returned it in a heartbeat with the local store giving me a replacement immediately.  Hence, I would be well on my way completing all the work that I must get done by the 15th of this month.  Honestly, at this point, I am not sure which justification will be acceptable if I don't get this resolve swiftly -- losing the company unnecessary money due to penalties and incomplete documents or getting fired for not getting the software installed as expected.

"I'm running Windows 7 Professional 64-bit on a Mac through VMware Fusion 4.  The installation was pretty quick (maybe around 30 minutes or less), but that may be partly due to a better processor and memory on my Mac.  I didn't encounter any problems installing the product from scratch.  Simply slide in the DVD when prompted by VMware and that's pretty much all you have to do.  So, even if you haven't had a chance to do a full install of Windows in the past, doing a full install on a Mac with VMware and Windows 7 is pretty straightforward.

I also installed Microsoft Office and Norton Antivirus and both were pretty straightforward.  The programs seem to be running faster than on my other machines.  I also don't intend to load up Windows with a lot of software as I now use my Mac primarily for non-work-related tasks, so that likely contributed to the faster run times.

The start up and shut down of Windows seems faster than XP and Vista.  Only time will tell if this speed will hold up.

The only problem that I encountered, which I am not completely sure who the culprit is - i.e., whether it is the Mac, VMware, Windows , or a combination of the three -  is that you have to turn off any Firewalls on the Mac side.  If you don't, you will not be able download and run most programs from the Internet.  For example, I tried downloading Acrobat Reader and an error saying something like ""not a valid win32 application"" pops up (this happens with many different programs).  An initial workaround that I tried was to download the file in a different PC and transfer it to the VM using an SD card.  That worked for Internet Explorer 9 and it installed without any problems.  But, for Acrobat Reader, the installation froze at 33% claiming some sort of Metafile error.  Once I turned off my Norton Firewall on the Mac side, I was able to download Acrobat Reader from the Internet and install the program without any problems.  This problem took me a few hours to fix.

UPGRADE ONLY, if your time isn't worth anything and you have hours to spend on line getting it to work properly. Spin the wheel and get lucky?

11. Pioneer BD-rw BluRay/DVD/CD writer
12. (next) Hauppauge 2255 HDTV pcie tuner

I put all these parts in the case and loaded Windows 10, and went to pour some coffee. It always takes a while to run a new build. I returned with my coffee, and the computer was asking what I wanted to do next, done, WHAT? Made me want to build these 4 profit it was so easy. Maybe I should have loaded win7 and spent a couple days upgrading, hahahahaha!!

I decided to test how efficient win10 was on a tough customer. My i7-860 was starting to slow down on the higher settings for the new Tomb Raider game. I loaded win10 with 16gb of memory and onboard Intel Graphics. TR would surely win this matchup. Nope, the system ran TR on normal just like my other i7 computer with win7. I have never seen a video game run on motherboard graphics, crazy!! Once I loaded the GTX 960 vidcard, TR had no chance, and rolled over to play dead at the ultimate high settings.

The newly replaced start menu is a nice compromise for all us familiar with Windows. I loaded up Cortana the verbal assisstant for the new win10. I need to get a new microphone, but the interface seemed to work quite well, and responded to my commands even with my crummy microphone. I know I have others stashed somewhere, but can't find 'em. I does take a little time to get it going, and the there are prompts that seem to go nowhere at times.

I put Adobe Lightroom and Nero 2015 on the win10 and all seem to run perfectly. The app for movies, TV, and music took quite a while to load and haven't been back to it yet but it did work. I have quite a bit of media, but Nero loaded much faster. I want to remind everyone that the crown jewel in the Windows world is not around anymore, MCE. Media Center ran TV, music, movies, Netflix, photos, etc. from one slick interface. That is history. You are now left to fend for yourself on how to get TV and other media to play. Between lawsuits and tired of answering questions, Microsoft wants to only be an operating system with you using apps like a Mac computer. Is the day of the tweaker a thing of the past?

All the hardware old and new I threw at it has run wonderfully. Most of the hardware and software from recent years has been updated to win10 drivers. Even some of the old drivers work too. I've been running win10 for only a month and am looking forward to using my new usb3.0 ports with 3.0 equipment I've owned for a couple years now, but ran on 2.0 this whole time. This computer is very fast, and restarts so fast it is nutty. I noticed in the Gigabyte motherboard bios it had two settings for faster booting, really, how is that possible? The minute you hit the restart button Win10 is back? It is already lightning fast to restart on slow mode?

I've found that it's usually better to get the ""pro"" version of any Microsoft release, if for no other reason than to maximize user control.  Windows 10, as with any Microsoft Operating System, has stuff that you will like, and other stuff that will make you say bad words within hearing distance of your mother.

What I can say for certain is that this Flash drive OS install was the easiest, most painless process I've had with an OS installation, and I thought Win7 was pretty easy.  This was smooth as silk with a brand new build, and I have not had any issues post install.

Sure, there are privacy issues, and some features have been changed or removed that I wish had not been.

"If you follow Quicken, you may recalled my review of Quicken Deluxe 2008. My main complaint was that the date field would revert to the current date whenever I temporarily left the entry to do something else. Frequently I ended up with several incorrect dates and had to go back and fix them.  Also I should mention that I only use the check registry and no other features.  This annoyance has been mostly corrected. You can go to Find, for example, and then return to the entry and the entered date will still be there.  If you wander too far, the date may revert, but the main problem has been resolved.  So far as I am concerned, this would be the main reason to upgrade from the 2008 version.

I did not find the new features useful.  I cannot make the ""flag"" feature do anything, so I gave up on it.  Now I would like to make OCCASIONAL use of the Tag and Notes features, but to do that, I would have to make them  available.  The problem is that this would add two extra keystrokes when entering a check as the Amount column is at the end.  Quicken claims that you can arrange the register's columns anyway you like, but I found I could not move the Amount column to be next to the Category field so as to avoid the extra keystrokes.  You would think that fields that are not used for every entry would be placed after the Amount field which has to be filled in for every entry.  Of course one could theoretically hide Tag and Notes and call them up only when needed, but surely the information on them ought to be visible all the time so that one does not overlook it. In any event, it is much easier to stick a notation into the Memo field rather than call up two other fields from time to time.

In all fairness, I think the Attachment feature might be useful but I have not yet have had occasion to try it.
In conclusion, if you do not yet have a program for keeping track of your checks or finances, I would strongly recommend Quicken Deluxe 2011.  Over the many years I have used Quicken, it has undoubtedly saved me hundreds of dollars in duplicate contributions or extended subscriptions, and thousands of hours of time. But if you already have a version of Quicken that works on your computer, and which you like, you may not need to upgrade.","Annoyance removed, but still not perfect",True,1292889600,0.0,0,1

"I paid alot of money for my Print Shop 20 Deluxe, and it constantly caused errors and had to be uninstalled and reinstalled. NO support from Broderbund EVER since 1995 for anything I ever purchased from them. Well now that for no reason that we can determine, it will not install on ANY of the 6 computers we have, wierd errors all over the place. I  suspect that they have made it where you can only install it so many times, such as Norton Symantec products do. So I ordered the NEW Print Shop Deluxe 22. What a horror! You have to download EVERYTHING online, and the only things on the program, and the program itself, look exactly like the Print Shop 20!! I do not recommend Broderbund software at all!!!!

Update, It is my fault I suppose that after one bad experience with the previous version of the Print Shop Deluxe that I went ahead and ordered the newest and again the newest editions. I was never able to access all of the content and I had to constantly reinstall the program. Now I just delete the email ads that I receive since the one that they sent saying download your digital content NOW before we close. I as I had done for what is now years told them that they had erased my previous history and it was not available to me on the site, to which  I never received a response. In theory it's a lovely program but it was not for me. I spent too much time and money trying to get the program to work, never mind use it. That is very frustrating.

Thankfully you can usually pick it up at a discounted price ($50 -vs- $60) at Amazon earlier than from other sellers (Intuit is usually the LAST one to offer a price-break),  I have only bought TTax on CD over the years (not digital download) so that I have the disc just in case I might need to re-install at some future (like IF the TaxMan were to come a'knockin', God forbid).

That's a small issue but still a issue.  The fact I put movies in and it won't let me use my mouse on my desktop to navigate through menus is enough for me to be completely unhappy and give this software a 1 star rating.  Its like having touchscreen software without having a touchscreen.  Why cant we access the onscreen menus with our mouse.  Now the price, anyone made enough to spend the 100$ on software that should initially be a player and shouldn't cost mouse than 20-30$, that's bad.  from 1998-20044ish I praised and recommended this software to people but now I cant justify that.

I would have canceled if I had known about the increase. (Maybe its in the fine print last year when I was signing up but I did not notice it).  The surprising thing is that many people would not notice such a high increase on their credit card for their subscription.  I have absolutely lost my respect for the Wall Street Journals in their business practice.  I'm just worry how I can stop the WSJ from me charging automatically next year and the year after it if they keep raising the rate every year.  I can' cancel my credit card since it is tie to other things.

Maybe if you do subscribe to the WSJ, its better to go a different route so you will NOT get the really high rate for a subscription renewal for the next .",Automatic Charge increase of aproximately 65 percent without notification .,False,1297555200,2.5649493574615367,0,0

It was as though Intuit was uploading all the names in the addressbook.

Moving along, the TurboTax program's wording was better but still bad, leaving customers in the dark, even if we could read. The program crashed repeatedly while trying to copy my files to CD so it really can't do that.  Other than that, it was a little faster and easier, I suppose due to more interaction with the Feds and California.  Was my return right?  I doubt it.

"The install went well. I preformed a fresh install. The machine I use is strictly for testing, I did not install this on a PC that I use daily.

It has the Intel 945 chipset that comes with integrated graphics Intel accelerator 950 video card.

Vista didn't recognize an old Laserjet 4 plus network printer but neither did did XP. It is a network printer so I set it up using IP printing.  My Open office ( a free office suite of applications that rivals MS Office) applications work well with Vista. Vista recognized my Canon camera. It didn't recognize an old Omni scanner that I have and there are no drivers for it on the but which is ok because I have a Mac that I do all my photo and scanning work on.

In general Vista is slower then XP on the same machine. The search functions take longer partially because it's doing a more complicated search. The login takes a little longer because it takes longer to load the user profile.

A breakdown of new and improved features.
The Windows software firewall works well but still is not a replacement for a hardware firewall. Vista's mobile computing is better then XP. The spyware is also getting better but I would still recommend lavasoft over the Vista defender spyware. The parental controls haven't changed much since XP. Windows Meeting space worked ok but Vista has to be installed on any computer joining the meeting. Windows meeting spaces replaces net meeting. Windows photo gallery is ok but seems to have lost some functionality over Windows photo manager. Windows has a thing called Gadgets. Mac users will recognize this it's very similar to Mac Widgets. It enables you to have applets on your desktop that will tell you the weather, sports tickers, calendars. Windows comes with a few gadgets and there are many more available on line. The Windows media center is nice. It does a good job of visualizing photo's, videos both stored locally and over a network.

"As a preface to this review, I am a software engineer.  I am highly critical of poorly-written software because I truly believe that it's just as easy to build things the right way.  Here are my initial comments and observations based on the first hour of using Quicken Home & Small Business 2015.  I previously used Quicken Home & Small Business 2012.

1. Right off the bat, the installation claimed it was going to check for the latest Quicken software update, but clearly did not (I had 2015 R1 installed from the DVD and I know 2015 R5 was available).

2. The very first ""update accounts"" action showed the same accounts under both succeeded and failed.  Yeah, that doesn't make any sense to me, either.

3. Clicking ""update Quicken"" from the ""update accounts"" screen caused Quicken to lock up.  The patch utility was stuck trying to close Quicken, but since the ""update accounts"" screen was still open the patch utility could not continue, so it just sat there frozen.  I had to kill the Quicken process and run the patch utility manually.  Some basic testing should have uncovered this.

4. The application startup takes forever.  The startup of Quicken 2012 takes 1-2 seconds at most.  The startup of Quicken 2015 often takes 2-3 minutes, during which time it looks like the application has completely frozen.

5. Basic interactions in the system are extremely slow.  Sometimes the application window flickers uncontrollably and the screen refreshes are so slow you can see the individual layers of the application being drawn.  Even something as simple as resizing the window triggers this behavior.  Keep in mind this is on an high-end development machine.

6. Requiring your users to have an Intuit account is asinine.  I can understand if users want to use the cloud services that it would be necessary, but it's an annoyance for everyone else.  Intuit, there's a reason I use software installed on my machine behind a firewall and not something like Mint.  I don't want to store all of my finances on your servers!

7. Even if you specify not to use cloud services and not to enable cloud sync, you'll receive an email telling you that Intuit has enabled a bunch of annoying alert emails that you'll get spammed with weekly.  In order to get to the screen to disable the alerts you actually have to first ENABLE cloud sync services.  Ridiculous.

Unless you are forced to upgrade to this version to get online services back (like I did), I would strongly suggest you skip the upgrade and hope the 2016 version is better.",Genuinely terrible software; skip this release if you can,False,1430092800,1.3862943611198906,0,0

"This is a very impressive piece of software for writing and playing back music.  I would recommend it highly to musicians who know musical terminology well and who want good-looking parts and scores.  This software will help you to produce results that are professional-looking.  Inputting is quick once you are familiar with the basics, and being able to generate individual parts from a score, play back the music, transpose or arrange it for other instruments, and a host of other applications, is great.  All that being said, I have a few comments and observations that may help some users who are still deciding whether it's the right choice for them.

I have been a Sibelius user since version 2.  At that time, Finale was the leading software for music, and I first saw Sibelius demonstrated at an academic conference for musicians.  (I am a retired university music professor.)  I liked how intuitive it was: slurs could be added and adjusted almost as you would do them by hand, and you can hear the pitches that you input at the keyboard, so mistakes can be caught easily.  Because Finale was used by many musicians at that time and often adopted by university music departments, I tried to learn Finale but became discouraged.  Then I bought Sibelius and have never regretted it. It is a very powerful program, and you can be up and running with it in a short time, but one cannot expect to learn everything it does immediately.  I know some composers who still prefer Finale, but today I believe Sibelius has taken over as the leading software for music publishers, editors, teachers, composers, and arrangers.

Since I began using Sibelius, I upgraded twice, first to Sibelius 4, and now to Sibelius 7.  (I bought a new computer that runs Windows 7, so that was the reason for buying Sibelius 7.)  Version 7 did not qualify as an ""upgrade"" for me, because I was coming from an older version of Sibelius, so I had to pay full price.  There are 4 discs in the box plus a small booklet with 15 pages of instructions, mostly on how to install Sibelius and how to activate it.  Installing it was no problem, but activating it is a rather daunting experience in some ways.  You are allowed to use Sibelius on 2 computers, and you must activate the copy on each of them separately.  If you later decide to switch computers (say, if you buy a new one), you must deactivate one copy and re-activate it on the new computer.  I do wish they would make this part a little easier.  Activating Sibelius without an internet connection, or with a public wireless connection (as I needed on my laptop), is especially difficult, although instructions are provided in the booklet.  Read them carefully; they do work.

The 4 discs are: Sibelius 7 (version 7.12 in my case), plus 3 more content discs.  These content discs include sound samples, photo score lite (music scanning software), audio score lite (to input music via microphone), and Scorch (to view, play, and print scores online).

I use Sibelius mainly to produce scores and parts for classical music.  Often I need specialized notational symbols, old notation such as ornament signs and unusual repeat signs, and specialized notations such as tablature.  With Sibelius, you can produce music in all kinds of old notations, all the way back to chant.  I have produced examples and scores that were submitted to publishers, and they were able to publish them directly from the high-resolution output from Sibelius.  My needs are not aligned with those of the average user, but this is just to demonstrate that Sibelius is very comprehensive and adaptable to individual needs. Also, there is a very large forum of Sibelius users online at the Sibelius site who have provided information on specific aspects of the program; it is very useful.  I had some questions about using French lute tablature that were answered by some very knowledgeable people who had already explored this aspect of Sibelius.  I was astonished that such an esoteric topic was known to other Sibelius users.  The help is well-indexed on the Sibelius website, so it was easy to find what I needed.

My biggest surprise with Sibelius 7 is that the initial interface is entirely different from what I was used to with Sibelius 4.  For a new user, it's probably more friendly, because it starts off with a choice of pre-prepared scores from which you can choose.  (In previous versions, one always built the score from a blank page.)  I recommend watching the videos that come with Sibelius to gain familiarity with these new features.  Once you go beyond the initial interface, the rest of the program is very similar to previous versions.  I also recommend buying the large book, Sibelius 7 Music Notation Essentials.  The information in the book is online too, but it's much easier to have it in hand while you are working.  My appreciation for Sibelius and all it can do improved immensely when I purchased the similar book for version 4.  It's really the best way to see what this extensive program can do.

If you are deciding whether to purchase Sibelius as a new user, I recommend using the trial version for a while before deciding.  If you are an experienced musician and music is an important part of your life, I don't think you will regret buying Sibelius, but try it out first.  It's not for everyone, but I couldn't be happier to have it. For me, it meets all my notational needs for music.",outstanding music software for the discerning user,True,1377907200,1.791759469228055,1,1
"Alright - I got a chance to play the game today. What I discovered is that this game is decent, but clearly not as fun or refined as Guitar Hero. I haven't explored everything, and haven't played multi-player, but I can tell you not to expect this game to have the level of excellence you experience with Guitar Hero.

First problem - platform. For most people, the computer is not an ideal place to play the game. Most of us don't have our PCs hooked up to the TV, so the game is just plain small.

Second problem - audio. The songs are good, but the guitar noises seem like they've just been ""added on"" to the song rather than fitting right in. Also, the whammy bar makes the music sound HORRIBLE.

Third problem - graphics. Granted there are no bikini clad women or satanic looking backgrounds, but the graphics are pretty lame. The background is boring, and the guitar area looks very simple compared with Guitar Hero.

Fourth problem - game play. The game is not as challenging, and you have to hit the notes a little early for it to work/sound right.

Biggest PLUS!!!! The music! I'd much rather have these songs stuck in my head than what's offered in Guitar Hero.

Overall, this is a decent effort. I'd like to see further developments and attention paid to the above concerns. The guitar itself is great. Seems very solid and very similar to Guitar Hero.

Taken for what it is, developed by a company that certainly doesn't have the financial backing (nor the potential sales) of Guitar Hero, this is a good product.

"It seems that some people are disappointed in the new iMovie, which is substantially different than the old one. The new one is much easier for most non-computer people to use, making it possible for just about anyone to make a movie quickly and easily. So what's wrong with that? That ease of use sacrifices many of the uber-advanced features that technical people love. Everything is packaged and ready-to-go to look good, but you can add advanced volume or video controls and filters. In the end, this will push the technical people to buy the more advanced Final Cut Express, and make the majority of the population able to finally make a movie quickly. What you think of this depends on what you want. Personally, I like it because I don't have a lot of time to satisfy my inner geek.

The other software is generally improved. I am a big fan of the new iPhoto events, which groups your photos according to the days and times you took the photos. For this to work, you've got to set your camera's time and date correctly; otherwise, the events are grouped into odd clusters. iWeb is improved with better management for personal sites. Garageband has a new Magic Garageband feature that makes it much easier to generate your own music. All of this software is more efficient at handling today's huge data files.

One caveat to all of this software is that there are more bugs than I'd like. Apple does do a good job fixing bugs, though, and most things I do work fine. Also, this software appreciates a newer Mac - either a 2.0 Ghz or faster G5 or an Intel Mac are required to use the new iMovie. So if you're using a G4 or older processor, you might be disappointed by the speed of this software. On the other hand, with a newer computer, you'll probably be impressed by the speed.

"The H&R At Home Deluxe Federal + E-file CD received from Amazon installs quickly enough.  On attempting to start the installed program I immediately receive a message saying that At Home is not running on the computer it was originally installed on.  That's silly because this is the only computer I have.  But I follow the suggestion to un-install, then re-install the software.  I get the same result, At Home won't start.

My on-line chat with H&R Support eventually leads to their request to check into Microsoft Update and install any missing ""Critical"" updates.  There are none.  But there are some ""Important"" ones.  However, they're for programs I don't have (e.g., Office 2003, Server 2005, etc.) or don't want (e.g., Internet Explorer 8).  H&R Support can't be any more specific about which updates might be necessary and I can't tell from the explanations of the updates which one(s) might affect At Home's inability to know where it's running.

I'm stuck.

I'm not going to install 8 updates willy-nilly, hoping one (or more) of them will solve the problem.  At Home is obviously checking some internal value somewhere that tells it where it thinks it was installed against some value stored in the bowels of 64-bit Windows Vista, but H&R Support can't tell me what At Home is looking for.

So I still have no clue why At Home won't even start up.  Has anyone else stumbled across this problem in 64-bit Vista (w/Service pack 1) and solved it?  If not, I'm going to have to return H&R Block At Home (2009) and see if I have any better luck with Turbo-Tax for 2009.

I'm frustrated because last year I switched from Turbo Tax to H&R Block Tax Cut and found it easy and simple to use.  Oh, well, back to Turbo Tax.

*** Update, Jan 12th, 2010 ***

An H&R At Home representative contacted me at home (no pun intended!) after reading the above review.  He apologized for the failure and said that I had encountered a known problem that wasn't related to ""critical"" Vista-64 updates. The problem affects some but not all Vista-64 users.  Anyway, nothing I might have done during or as a result of the on-line chat would have solved my problem.  He said they have a fix in hand for the problem and that they expect to have it available for download on Jan 15th. All in all, well handled by H&R and a good public relations endeavor.

"Years ago I'd switched over from Vegas Movie Studio to Vegas Pro because I wanted to have more video/audio tracks available, motion titling, and secondary color correction (for the famou ""Sin City"" effect).  Unfortunately Vegas Pro is a daunting program to learn with a lot of features a lot of average home users wouldn't ordinarily use in their video productions like extensive sound remixing controls, special video format support, and multi-camera editing.  It also lacks the built in wizards that Movie Studio have to aid a non-professional to the proper workflow for say out putting to DVD or to YouTube.  Sony has now added all the things I had switch to Pro for in the Movie Studio Platinum line as well as music, more effects, 3D movie editing, Blue Ray Disk authoring, and even slide show creation.  The interface now has more flexibility with the editing Window at the top right of the screen where one more intuitively expects to see the effects ones edits.  Vegas Movie Studio is still not a terribly intuitive program to learn, but this version has a quick start tutorial DVD.  I think for the advanced amatauer who doesn't have the huge amount of money to clunk down for Sony Vegas Pro or the even more bank account draining Adobe Premier that they couldn't go wrong than to buy this program.  Vegas is also gentle on system resources and is less likely to run out of memory or have choppy previews for high definition video editing than other editors I've used.

When compared to Abdobe Premier Elements and Pinnacle Studio, Vegas Movie Studio has much more to offer.  I had tried Premier Elements before and disliked many of it's intrusive automation features--I do not want the software to determine whether or not my clip is good enough to use and I loathe it's media organizer.  It also requires an expensive annual membership to access all the available filters that come with the program and access to many online tutorials.  Pinnacle Studio lacks true multi-track video editing as you are limited to your video track, a title track and one secondary track.  Sony Vegas Movie Studio is really a powerful program with something for someone of every level.  The Platinum Version too complicated?  Start off the the ""beginner"" version and you can eventually work your way up to the more complex, more full featured version.  I will say this, however, if you just want to throw some clips at a program and have it slice it, dice it, apply themes, and random effects this isn't the application for you--if you want those features go with Premier Elements of Pinnacle Studio instead.

The only Cons I have for the Vegas line is that it lacks any type of integrated music generation program and 64 Bit support.  Vegas had Cinescore at one time, but due to a lawsuite from Smart Sound had to shelf it and have failed to come up with any alternative royalty free music geneation system.  The provided music is essentially loops that can be woven together in a very complicated fashion to create a longer score but is not a viable option for many home users.  The lack of any integrated music support is the only things I really don't like and hope they are able to rectify in the future.  Of course you can use any music you want for your home productions for yourself and family as long as you don't post it on YouTube or other websites where copyright issues flourish.  Royalty free music is available that can be used for the web but is very expensive generally speaking.  If you have a copy of Cinescore from a previous version of Vegas it will still work with this version.  The only other thing is that it lacks 64 bit support and runs under 32 bit (regardless of your computers OS). Only Vegas Pro currently offeres 64 bit support--but if you went with that you'd have to have the 32 bit version installed to use many of the plug-ins.",A Forward Step in Vegas Movie Studio Evolution,True,1331856000,2.302585092994046,1,1

"If you've been using spreadsheets or other basic accounting software, moving to QuickBooks and its double entry accounting system is a clear win. I've found it to be an indispensable tool for maintaining accurate books, but the product still has room to improve.

The Mac version is quite good, but you'll want to keep these points in mind:
- There is not feature parity between the Windows and Mac versions. Check the product details in case you need any omitted features.
- Check the website to see whether your bank is supported if online banking is important to you. I assumed because Quicken supported my bank so would this product, but not so.
- There is no fixed asset manager, so tracking these has to be done through subaccounts and an external spreadsheet. Given even many small businesses need to track these, this is much more painful than it needs to be. Even an option to create the standard asset, cost, and depreciation subaccounts all at once would be helpful, though a real asset manager and depreciation calculator would be much better.
- Regardless of the advertising, unless you have an accountant who doesn't mind updating all your entries, you actually do need to know not only the basics of double entry accounting, but also how to handle specific tax, asset, and equity situations and record them correctly on the books such as depreciation, retained earnings, paid in capital, partner distributions, etc. Accountants handle these in various ways, but I was still surprised to find no ""best practice"" instructions included.
- Unfortunately due to tax codes, there is often a difference between GAAP book depreciation and tax depreciation, and QuickBooks provides no easy means to handle this distinction that I've discovered yet.
- At the end of the year, there are certain steps that need to be performed to close the books depending on the type of business you have, and if you don't know what those are you'll have to check with an accountant because QuickBooks offers no guidance that I could find.
- The Mac version does not correctly compute Retained Earnings on reports except for the Balance Sheet report. This is rather frustrating if you expect to be able to review the RE account for partner share distributions or for tax purposes. You can work around it by running reports to compute Net Income and such, but this should not be necessary as demonstrated by the Windows version.

Overall, QuickBooks is a product I wouldn't do without, and the Mac version has worked well for my needs, but I would love to see Intuit close the gaps I mentioned in a future update.",Indispensable but room to improve,True,1392336000,1.9459101490553128,1,1

"I have been using OneCare since it came out over a year ago. I had been using Norton/Symmantec products before that. OneCare seems to run much more effieciently. When it does its scheduled virus definition updates, virus scans, defrag, file cleanup, etc, you don't notice the huge performance drop like with Norton. And the backups take very little time (after the first one) since they are incremental, even if backing up to DVD rather than hard drive. Norton caused my older laptop to barely function. Norton is very hard to get rid of, especially versions 2002 and older. Under OneCare the old laptop breezes along though I did have to reload the operating system & all it's software to get rid of Norton. The hard drive eventually died unexpectedly but since I had the OneCare backups I was able to restore everything I needed. My only complaint is that since I didn't want to restore everything, I could only search for filenames. It would not return directory names and I would have liked to be able to restore several entire directories.

A downside of the backups is that they are encrypted and you can not access them without having OneCare installed. But you could always download the trial version and use it to get the backup restored.

When you buy the boxed version (usually cheaper than downloading it), you don't really need anything inside except the license key. The software on the CD justs links you to the latest version on the web. The box is big and hard to open. Must be a theft-prevention thing since it wastes materials. The plastic is probably recyclable, though.

I have it installed on two of my pc's and have installed it on the PC's of several friends. It does require having a (free) Windows Live ID which you need to remember so you can install it on additional PC's (up to three).

"Sometimes its the product that's bad and sometimes its the support. In this case, the product is fairly simple, fairly easy to use, AND has bugs and issues such as its pickiness with MDAC (Microsoft Data Access Components). This issue and others should be relatively easy to address, HOWEVER... The manual does not have an installation OR troubleshooting section. Searching the box, there seems to be a lack of website listed to contact the creators to ask what it means when it says ""administrator permissions needed to install this product on Windows XP and Vista."" Many folks are going to wonder about that, especially when the product produces an error on XP that fails to allow you to actually print invoices... No sweat, you think, since the product is made by Broderbund and should have support at their website.. Au contraire! Broderbund doesn't list this product. Further review suggests it's actually an ""Encore"" product. Referring to the Encore Support site, you ALSO find this product missing. Sending a message to EITHER website for support generates a ticket and email that cheerfully informs you your request will be deleted if the product in question is not listed on their website.

If it doesn't, your chances of locating and receiving support are about the same as having lunch today with your preferred deity. I recommend you pass on this product.

"Since I use the Apple Mac, there are very limited choices when it comes to an astrological program like this.  Hence I was a little worried, and it is kind of expensive, but it works like a charm -- is very easy to use, and is all that it is claimed to be.  I only bought the basic edition, and there are some limitations, but according to the documentation I can upgrade if I want to.  As a kind of verification that I had made the right choice, this is one of the programs recommended by the lady who wrote ""Astrology for Dummies"" which I also bought at the same time, and did not know this.

One last thing to mention about this company -- they shipped this very well packaged via registered mail.  I did not expect that, but was very pleased.

If you are interested in a very easy to use, and quite complete, astrology program, I think you would be pleased with this product.  In fact, you really don't even have to know much about astrology to use it -- but if you do know much, it is the basic tool you will need to do serious study.

Be sure and check out the features of all three versions first before you buy -- the more expensive versions offer more capability.  For me, I did not need, or want, that much, hence the basic version works fine for me, but if you are going to get really serious into the study you might want to go with one of the more expensive versions.",Very pleased!,True,1397347200,3.218875824868201,1,1

"OK, I read all the reviews and took the plunge anyway. I regret it. If you're on the fence, wait a year and see if they can improve it. I was running the PC version on a very old Windows machine that was dying and had to move to my new Mac, but a better solution I think would have been to get a windows emulator and run the windows version on my Mac.

Things started out OK. The transfer went well enough, although I had a problem around what I'm sure Quicken would consider an edge case --  having bank accounts in both US and Canadian currency. The PC version knew how to capture an exchange rate for each transfer of funds between accounts, but the Mac version enforces that $1 USD = $1 CAD. All of my historical transfers that were imported were now wrong on one side of the transfer. I made a balance adjustment in the Canadian account to make the current balance match reality and moved on, knowing that historical reports are not going to show the actual correct balance. (No worries, the reporting function is underdeveloped in Mac version anyway).

After about 6 weeks, I was getting pretty comfortable with Quicken for Mac. Sure there were workarounds, but I was able to get it to work, and be correct. This week, I encountered a bug that Quicken acknowledged is a ""feature working as designed"" that will ""be addressed in a future release"" (yes the support agent actually said both of those things in the same sentence). The issue is that the share balance in my brokerage accounts are locked to the share balance at the time of transfer. Every time I enter a ""buy"" transaction, the portfolio view does not update the balance of shares, and shows an entry with a negative balance of shares. Every buy transaction increases this negative share entry. When I click on it, Quicken tells me that the share balance does not match what was reported by my brokerage, and Quicken is sticking with what was reported by the brokerage. The problem is that I do not have online synching enabled for this account on Quicken for Mac. I did for the windows version, but synching actually isn't supported for this account in the Mac version so I'm stuck. The amount of shares at the time of the transfer is all that Quicken will ever acknowledge exists. Every ""buy"" transaction lowers the overall net worth in quicken because cash disappears and no corresponding asset is created. This is a fatal flaw for me -- if the balances are not correct, I can't trust what I see in Quicken and then there's no point in using it.

There is a report of this issue in the Quicken support forums at https://qlc.intuit.com/questions/1015461-buying-shares-issue, but no response.

So, buyer beware. I'd give Intuit another year or two to work out the kinks.

Yes, there is less functionality but I learned to live with it and find new ways to do everything I needed for managing day-to-day finances.

"I have had to set up a few new installs of the Vista Business on some servers and I was disappointed with the overall performance.

My biggest gripe is when I tried to remotely log in from another PC and I sat there waiting and waiting only to discover that the Vista default setup is to ask permission to run even the most basic operations and was actually sitting there waiting for someone to click 'YES' to allow the process to run. How irritating! Kinda self defeats the idea of remotely logging in doesn't it?.

Also if you happen to rename the administrator account the change is not registered somewhere in the Remote Connections authorization. So when I *thought* I was remotely logging in under the new admin account name Vista wouldn't let me in and it was only after searching for what seemed an eternity - some hidden place it took me 15 minutes to find, I discovered that the the new admin account name had not been authorized when I did the name change. yikes!

For those who need to run VNC Server on Vista, be aware there are issues -  installing and running that you will need to work around as well.
